Overview
Svelte is a framework for building user interfaces on the web. It uses a compiler to turn declarative components written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript...

App

<script lang="ts">
	function greet() {
		alert('Welcome to Svelte!');
	}
</script>

<button onclick={greet}>click me</button>

<style>
	button {
		font-size: 2em;
	}
</style>
...into lean, tightly optimized JavaScript.

You can use it to build anything on the web, from standalone components to ambitious full stack apps (using Svelte’s companion application framework, SvelteKit) and everything in between.

These pages serve as reference documentation. If you’re new to Svelte, we recommend starting with the interactive tutorial and coming back here when you have questions.

You can also try Svelte online in the playground or, if you need a more fully-featured environment, on StackBlitz.

Getting help
We recommend using SvelteKit, which lets you build almost anything. It’s the official application framework from the Svelte team and powered by Vite. Create a new project with:


npx sv create myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev
Don’t worry if you don’t know Svelte yet! You can ignore all the nice features SvelteKit brings on top for now and dive into it later.

Alternatives to SvelteKit
You can also use Svelte directly with Vite by running npm create vite@latest and selecting the svelte option. With this, npm run build will generate HTML, JS, and CSS files inside the dist directory using vite-plugin-svelte. In most cases, you will probably need to choose a routing library as well.

Vite is often used in standalone mode to build single page apps (SPAs), which you can also build with SvelteKit.

There are also plugins for other bundlers, but we recommend Vite.

Editor tooling
The Svelte team maintains a VS Code extension, and there are integrations with various other editors and tools as well.

You can also check your code from the command line using sv check.

Don’t be shy about asking for help in the Discord chatroom! You can also find answers on Stack Overflow.

.svelte files
<script>
<script module>
<style>
Components are the building blocks of Svelte applications. They are written into .svelte files, using a superset of HTML.

All three sections — script, styles and markup — are optional.

MyComponent

<script module>
	// module-level logic goes here
	// (you will rarely use this)
</script>

<script lang="ts">
	// instance-level logic goes here
</script>

<!-- markup (zero or more items) goes here -->

<style>
	/* styles go here */
</style>
<script>
A <script> block contains JavaScript (or TypeScript, when adding the lang="ts" attribute) that runs when a component instance is created. Variables declared (or imported) at the top level can be referenced in the component’s markup.

In addition to normal JavaScript, you can use runes to declare component props and add reactivity to your component. Runes are covered in the next section.

<script module>
A <script> tag with a module attribute runs once when the module first evaluates, rather than for each component instance. Variables declared in this block can be referenced elsewhere in the component, but not vice versa.


<script module>
	let total = 0;
</script>

<script>
	total += 1;
	console.log(`instantiated ${total} times`);
</script>
You can export bindings from this block, and they will become exports of the compiled module. You cannot export default, since the default export is the component itself.

If you are using TypeScript and import such exports from a module block into a .ts file, make sure to have your editor setup so that TypeScript knows about them. This is the case for our VS Code extension and the IntelliJ plugin, but in other cases you might need to setup our TypeScript editor plugin.

In Svelte 4, this script tag was created using <script context="module">

<style>
CSS inside a <style> block will be scoped to that component.


<style>
	p {
		/* this will only affect <p> elements in this component */
		color: burlywood;
	}
</style>

.svelte.js and .svelte.ts files
Besides .svelte files, Svelte also operates on .svelte.js and .svelte.ts files.

These behave like any other .js or .ts module, except that you can use runes. This is useful for creating reusable reactive logic, or sharing reactive state across your app (though note that you cannot export reassigned state).

This is a concept that didn’t exist prior to Svelte 5

What are runes?
rune /ruːn/ noun

A letter or mark used as a mystical or magic symbol.

Runes are symbols that you use in .svelte and .svelte.js / .svelte.ts files to control the Svelte compiler. If you think of Svelte as a language, runes are part of the syntax — they are keywords.

Runes have a $ prefix and look like functions:


let message = $state('hello');
They differ from normal JavaScript functions in important ways, however:

You don’t need to import them — they are part of the language
They’re not values — you can’t assign them to a variable or pass them as arguments to a function
Just like JavaScript keywords, they are only valid in certain positions (the compiler will help you if you put them in the wrong place)
Runes didn’t exist prior to Svelte 5.

$state

Passing state into functions
Passing state across modules
The $state rune allows you to create reactive state, which means that your UI reacts when it changes.


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
Unlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — count is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.

Deep state
If $state is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive state proxy. Proxies allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like array.push(...), triggering granular updates.

State is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with Object.create). In a case like this...


let todos = $state([
	{
		done: false,
		text: 'add more todos'
	}
]);
...modifying an individual todo’s property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:


todos[0].done = !todos[0].done;
If you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:


todos.push({
	done: false,
	text: 'eat lunch'
});
When you update properties of proxies, the original object is not mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, you should wrap the object after wrapping it in $state.

Note that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:


let { done, text } = todos[0];

// this will not affect the value of `done`
todos[0].done = !todos[0].done;
Classes
Class instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use $state in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the constructor:


class Todo {
	done = $state(false);

	constructor(text) {
		this.text = $state(text);
	}

	reset() {
		this.text = '';
		this.done = false;
	}
}
The compiler transforms done and text into get / set methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.

When calling methods in JavaScript, the value of this matters. This won’t work, because this inside the reset method will be the <button> rather than the Todo:


<button onclick={todo.reset}>
	reset
</button>
You can either use an inline function...


<button onclick={() => todo.reset()}>
	reset
</button>
...or use an arrow function in the class definition:


class Todo {
	done = $state(false);

	constructor(text) {
		this.text = $state(text);
	}

	reset = () => {
		this.text = '';
		this.done = false;
	}
}
Built-in classes
Svelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like Set, Map, Date and URL that can be imported from svelte/reactivity.

$state.raw
In cases where you don’t want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use $state.raw.

State declared with $state.raw cannot be mutated; it can only be reassigned. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like push, replace the object or array altogether if you’d like to update it:


let person = $state.raw({
	name: 'Heraclitus',
	age: 49
});

// this will have no effect
person.age += 1;

// this will work, because we're creating a new person
person = {
	name: 'Heraclitus',
	age: 50
};
This can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren’t planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can contain reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).

As with $state, you can declare class fields using $state.raw.

$state.snapshot
To take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive $state proxy, use $state.snapshot:


<script>
	let counter = $state({ count: 0 });

	function onclick() {
		// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`
		console.log($state.snapshot(counter));
	}
</script>
This is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn’t expect a proxy, such as structuredClone.

$state.eager
When state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an await expression, because updates are synchronized.

In some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use $state.eager(value):


<nav>
	<a href="/" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>
	<a href="/about" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>
</nav>
Use this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.

Passing state into functions
JavaScript is a pass-by-value language — when you call a function, the arguments are the values rather than the variables. In other words:

index

function add(a: number, b: number) {
	return a + b;
}

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let total = add(a, b);
console.log(total); // 3

a = 3;
b = 4;
console.log(total); // still 3!
If add wanted to have access to the current values of a and b, and to return the current total value, you would need to use functions instead:

index

function add(getA: () => number, getB: () => number) {
	return () => getA() + getB();
}

let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let total = add(() => a, () => b);
console.log(total()); // 3

a = 3;
b = 4;
console.log(total()); // 7
State in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the $state rune...


let a = $state(1);
let b = $state(2);
...you’re accessing its current value.

Note that ‘functions’ is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and get/set properties...

index

function add(input: { a: number, b: number }) {
	return {
		get value() {
			return input.a + input.b;
		}
	};
}

let input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });
let total = add(input);
console.log(total.value); // 3

input.a = 3;
input.b = 4;
console.log(total.value); // 7
...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using classes instead.

Passing state across modules
You can declare state in .svelte.js and .svelte.ts files, but you can only export that state if it’s not directly reassigned. In other words you can’t do this:

state.svelte

export let count = $state(0);

export function increment() {
	count += 1;
}
That’s because every reference to count is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:

state.svelte

export let count = $.state(0);

export function increment() {
	$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);
}
You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the ‘JS Output’ tab in the playground.

Since the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports count Svelte doesn’t know that it needs to wrap each reference in $.get and $.set:


import { count } from './state.svelte.js';

console.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'
This leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don’t reassign it...


// This is allowed — since we're updating
// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,
// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`
export const counter = $state({
	count: 0
});

export function increment() {
	counter.count += 1;
}
...or don’t directly export it:


let count = $state(0);

export function getCount() {
	return count;
}

export function increment() {
	count += 1;
}

$derived

Understanding dependencies
Overriding derived values
Deriveds and reactivity

Update propagation
Derived state is declared with the $derived rune:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	{doubled}
</button>

<p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>
The expression inside $derived(...) should be free of side-effects. Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. count++) inside derived expressions.

As with $state, you can mark class fields as $derived.

Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the $derived rune, doubled would maintain its original value even when count changes.

$derived.by
Sometimes you need to create complex derivations that don’t fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use $derived.by which accepts a function as its argument.


<script>
	let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);
	let total = $derived.by(() => {
		let total = 0;
		for (const n of numbers) {
			total += n;
		}
		return total;
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>
	{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}
</button>
In essence, $derived(expression) is equivalent to $derived.by(() => expression).

Understanding dependencies
Anything read synchronously inside the $derived expression (or $derived.by function body) is considered a dependency of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as dirty and recalculated when it is next read.

To exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use untrack.

Overriding derived values
Derived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with const). This can be useful for things like optimistic UI, where a value is derived from the ‘source of truth’ (such as data from your server) but you’d like to show immediate feedback to the user:


<script>
	let { post, like } = $props();

	let likes = $derived(post.likes);

	async function onclick() {
		// increment the `likes` count immediately...
		likes += 1;

		// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`
		try {
			await like();
		} catch {
			// failed! roll back the change
			likes -= 1;
		}
	}
</script>

<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>
Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.

Deriveds and reactivity
Unlike $state, which converts objects and arrays to deeply reactive proxies, $derived values are left as-is. For example, in a case like this...


let items = $state([ /*...*/ ]);

let index = $state(0);
let selected = $derived(items[index]);
...you can change (or bind: to) properties of selected and it will affect the underlying items array. If items was not deeply reactive, mutating selected would have no effect.

Destructuring
If you use destructuring with a $derived declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...


let { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());
...is roughly equivalent to this:


let _stuff = $derived(stuff());
let a = $derived(_stuff.a);
let b = $derived(_stuff.b);
let c = $derived(_stuff.c);
Update propagation
Svelte uses something called push-pull reactivity — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the ‘push’), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the ‘pull’).

If the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when large changes, not when count changes, even though large depends on count:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let large = $derived(count > 10);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	{large}
</button>

When not to use $effect
Effects are functions that run when state updates, and can be used for things like calling third-party libraries, drawing on <canvas> elements, or making network requests. They only run in the browser, not during server-side rendering.

Generally speaking, you should not update state inside effects, as it will make code more convoluted and will often lead to never-ending update cycles. If you find yourself doing so, see when not to use $effect to learn about alternative approaches.

You can create an effect with the $effect rune (demo):


<script>
	let size = $state(50);
	let color = $state('#ff3e00');

	let canvas;

	$effect(() => {
		const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
		context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

		// this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change
		context.fillStyle = color;
		context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size);
	});
</script>

<canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100"></canvas>
When Svelte runs an effect function, it tracks which pieces of state (and derived state) are accessed (unless accessed inside untrack), and re-runs the function when that state later changes.

If you’re having difficulty understanding why your $effect is rerunning or is not running see understanding dependencies. Effects are triggered differently than the $: blocks you may be used to if coming from Svelte 4.

Understanding lifecycle
Your effects run after the component has been mounted to the DOM, and in a microtask after state changes. Re-runs are batched (i.e. changing color and size in the same moment won’t cause two separate runs), and happen after any DOM updates have been applied.

You can use $effect anywhere, not just at the top level of a component, as long as it is called while a parent effect is running.

Svelte uses effects internally to represent logic and expressions in your template — this is how <h1>hello {name}!</h1> updates when name changes.

An effect can return a teardown function which will run immediately before the effect re-runs (demo).


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let milliseconds = $state(1000);

	$effect(() => {
		// This will be recreated whenever `milliseconds` changes
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			count += 1;
		}, milliseconds);

		return () => {
			// if a teardown function is provided, it will run
			// a) immediately before the effect re-runs
			// b) when the component is destroyed
			clearInterval(interval);
		};
	});
</script>

<h1>{count}</h1>

<button onclick={() => (milliseconds *= 2)}>slower</button>
<button onclick={() => (milliseconds /= 2)}>faster</button>
Teardown functions also run when the effect is destroyed, which happens when its parent is destroyed (for example, a component is unmounted) or the parent effect re-runs.

Understanding dependencies
$effect automatically picks up any reactive values ($state, $derived, $props) that are synchronously read inside its function body (including indirectly, via function calls) and registers them as dependencies. When those dependencies change, the $effect schedules a re-run.

If $state and $derived are used directly inside the $effect (for example, during creation of a reactive class), those values will not be treated as dependencies.

Values that are read asynchronously — after an await or inside a setTimeout, for example — will not be tracked. Here, the canvas will be repainted when color changes, but not when size changes (demo):


$effect(() => {
	const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
	context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	// this will re-run whenever `color` changes...
	context.fillStyle = color;

	setTimeout(() => {
		// ...but not when `size` changes
		context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size);
	}, 0);
});
An effect only reruns when the object it reads changes, not when a property inside it changes. (If you want to observe changes inside an object at dev time, you can use $inspect.)


<script>
	let state = $state({ value: 0 });
	let derived = $derived({ value: state.value * 2 });

	// this will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated)
	$effect(() => {
		state;
	});

	// this will run whenever `state.value` changes...
	$effect(() => {
		state.value;
	});

	// ...and so will this, because `derived` is a new object each time
	$effect(() => {
		derived;
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => (state.value += 1)}>
	{state.value}
</button>

<p>{state.value} doubled is {derived.value}</p>
An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran. This has interesting implications for effects that have conditional code.

For instance, if condition is true in the code snippet below, the code inside the if block will run and color will be evaluated. This means that changes to either condition or color will cause the effect to re-run.

Conversely, if condition is false, color will not be evaluated, and the effect will only re-run again when condition changes.


import confetti from 'canvas-confetti';

let condition = $state(true);
let color = $state('#ff3e00');

$effect(() => {
	if (condition) {
		confetti({ colors: [color] });
	} else {
		confetti();
	}
});
$effect.pre
In rare cases, you may need to run code before the DOM updates. For this we can use the $effect.pre rune:


<script>
	import { tick } from 'svelte';

	let div = $state();
	let messages = $state([]);

	// ...

	$effect.pre(() => {
		if (!div) return; // not yet mounted

		// reference `messages` array length so that this code re-runs whenever it changes
		messages.length;

		// autoscroll when new messages are added
		if (div.offsetHeight + div.scrollTop > div.scrollHeight - 20) {
			tick().then(() => {
				div.scrollTo(0, div.scrollHeight);
			});
		}
	});
</script>

<div bind:this={div}>
	{#each messages as message}
		<p>{message}</p>
	{/each}
</div>
Apart from the timing, $effect.pre works exactly like $effect.

$effect.tracking
The $effect.tracking rune is an advanced feature that tells you whether or not the code is running inside a tracking context, such as an effect or inside your template (demo):


<script>
	console.log('in component setup:', $effect.tracking()); // false

	$effect(() => {
		console.log('in effect:', $effect.tracking()); // true
	});
</script>

<p>in template: {$effect.tracking()}</p> <!-- true -->
It is used to implement abstractions like createSubscriber, which will create listeners to update reactive values but only if those values are being tracked (rather than, for example, read inside an event handler).

$effect.pending
When using await in components, the $effect.pending() rune tells you how many promises are pending in the current boundary, not including child boundaries (demo):


<button onclick={() => a++}>a++</button>
<button onclick={() => b++}>b++</button>

<p>{a} + {b} = {await add(a, b)}</p>

{#if $effect.pending()}
	<p>pending promises: {$effect.pending()}</p>
{/if}
$effect.root
The $effect.root rune is an advanced feature that creates a non-tracked scope that doesn’t auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control. This rune also allows for the creation of effects outside of the component initialisation phase.


const destroy = $effect.root(() => {
	$effect(() => {
		// setup
	});

	return () => {
		// cleanup
	};
});

// later...
destroy();
When not to use $effect
In general, $effect is best considered something of an escape hatch — useful for things like analytics and direct DOM manipulation — rather than a tool you should use frequently. In particular, avoid using it to synchronise state. Instead of this...


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $state();

	// don't do this!
	$effect(() => {
		doubled = count * 2;
	});
</script>
...do this:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>
For things that are more complicated than a simple expression like count * 2, you can also use $derived.by.

If you’re using an effect because you want to be able to reassign the derived value (to build an optimistic UI, for example) note that deriveds can be directly overridden as of Svelte 5.25.

You might be tempted to do something convoluted with effects to link one value to another. The following example shows two inputs for “money spent” and “money left” that are connected to each other. If you update one, the other should update accordingly. Don’t use effects for this (demo):


<script>
	const total = 100;
	let spent = $state(0);
	let left = $state(total);

	$effect(() => {
		left = total - spent;
	});

	$effect(() => {
		spent = total - left;
	});
</script>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} />
	{spent}/{total} spent
</label>

<label>
	<input type="range" bind:value={left} max={total} />
	{left}/{total} left
</label>
Instead, use oninput callbacks or — better still — function bindings where possible (demo):


<script>
	const total = 100;
	let spent = $state(0);
	let left = $derived(total - spent);

	function updateLeft(left) {

If you absolutely have to update $state within an effect and run into an infinite loop because you read and write to the same $state, use untrack.

Fallback values

Updating props
Type safety
$props.id()
The inputs to a component are referred to as props, which is short for properties. You pass props to components just like you pass attributes to elements:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';
</script>

<MyComponent adjective="cool" />
On the other side, inside MyComponent.svelte, we can receive props with the $props rune...

MyComponent

<script lang="ts">
	let props = $props();
</script>

<p>this component is {props.adjective}</p>
...though more commonly, you’ll destructure your props:

MyComponent

<script lang="ts">
	let { adjective } = $props();
</script>

<p>this component is {adjective}</p>
Fallback values
Destructuring allows us to declare fallback values, which are used if the parent component does not set a given prop (or the value is undefined):


let { adjective = 'happy' } = $props();
Fallback values are not turned into reactive state proxies (see Updating props for more info)

Renaming props
We can also use the destructuring assignment to rename props, which is necessary if they’re invalid identifiers, or a JavaScript keyword like super:


let { super: trouper = 'lights are gonna find me' } = $props();
Rest props
Finally, we can use a rest property to get, well, the rest of the props:


let { a, b, c, ...others } = $props();
Updating props
References to a prop inside a component update when the prop itself updates — when count changes in App.svelte, it will also change inside Child.svelte. But the child component is able to temporarily override the prop value, which can be useful for unsaved ephemeral state (demo):

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Child from './Child.svelte';

	let count = $state(0);
</script>

<button onclick={() => (count += 1)}>
	clicks (parent): {count}
</button>

<Child {count} />
Child

<script lang="ts">
	let { count } = $props();
</script>

<button onclick={() => (count += 1)}>
	clicks (child): {count}
</button>
While you can temporarily reassign props, you should not mutate props unless they are bindable.

If the prop is a regular object, the mutation will have no effect (demo):

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Child from './Child.svelte';
</script>

<Child object={{ count: 0 }} />
Child

<script lang="ts">
	let { object } = $props();
</script>

<button onclick={() => {
	// has no effect
	object.count += 1
}}>
	clicks: {object.count}
</button>
If the prop is a reactive state proxy, however, then mutations will have an effect but you will see an ownership_invalid_mutation warning, because the component is mutating state that does not ‘belong’ to it (demo):

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Child from './Child.svelte';

	let object = $state({count: 0});
</script>

<Child {object} />
Child

<script lang="ts">
	let { object } = $props();
</script>

<button onclick={() => {
	// will cause the count below to update,
	// but with a warning. Don't mutate
	// objects you don't own!
	object.count += 1
}}>
	clicks: {object.count}
</button>
The fallback value of a prop not declared with $bindable is left untouched — it is not turned into a reactive state proxy — meaning mutations will not cause updates (demo)

Child

<script lang="ts">
	let { object = { count: 0 } } = $props();
</script>

<button onclick={() => {
	// has no effect if the fallback value is used
	object.count += 1
}}>
	clicks: {object.count}
</button>
In summary: don’t mutate props. Either use callback props to communicate changes, or — if parent and child should share the same object — use the $bindable rune.

Type safety
You can add type safety to your components by annotating your props, as you would with any other variable declaration. In TypeScript that might look like this...


<script lang="ts">
	let { adjective }: { adjective: string } = $props();
</script>
...while in JSDoc you can do this:


<script>
	/** @type {{ adjective: string }} */
	let { adjective } = $props();
</script>
You can, of course, separate the type declaration from the annotation:


<script lang="ts">
	interface Props {
		adjective: string;
	}

	let { adjective }: Props = $props();
</script>
Interfaces for native DOM elements are provided in the svelte/elements module (see Typing wrapper components)

Adding types is recommended, as it ensures that people using your component can easily discover which props they should provide.

$props.id()
This rune, added in version 5.20.0, generates an ID that is unique to the current component instance. When hydrating a server-rendered component, the value will be consistent between server and client.

This is useful for linking elements via attributes like for and aria-labelledby.


<script>
	const uid = $props.id();
</script>

<form>
	<label for="{uid}-firstname">First Name: </label>
	<input id="{uid}-firstname" type="text" />

	<label for="{uid}-lastname">Last Name: </label>
	<input id="{uid}-lastname" type="text" />
</form>

$bindable
Ordinarily, props go one way, from parent to child. This makes it easy to understand how data flows around your app.

In Svelte, component props can be bound, which means that data can also flow up from child to parent. This isn’t something you should do often, but it can simplify your code if used sparingly and carefully.

It also means that a state proxy can be mutated in the child.

Mutation is also possible with normal props, but is strongly discouraged — Svelte will warn you if it detects that a component is mutating state it does not ‘own’.

To mark a prop as bindable, we use the $bindable rune:

FancyInput

<script lang="ts">
	let { value = $bindable(), ...props } = $props();
</script>

<input bind:value={value} {...props} />

<style>
	input {
		font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';
		color: deeppink;
	}
</style>
Now, a component that uses <FancyInput> can add the bind: directive (demo):

App

<script lang="ts">
	import FancyInput from './FancyInput.svelte';

	let message = $state('hello');
</script>

<FancyInput bind:value={message} />
<p>{message}</p>
The parent component doesn’t have to use bind: — it can just pass a normal prop. Some parents don’t want to listen to what their children have to say.

In this case, you can specify a fallback value for when no prop is passed at all:

FancyInput

let { value = $bindable('fallback'), ...props } = $props();

$inspect
$inspect(...).with
$inspect.trace(...)
$inspect only works during development. In a production build it becomes a noop.

The $inspect rune is roughly equivalent to console.log, with the exception that it will re-run whenever its argument changes. $inspect tracks reactive state deeply, meaning that updating something inside an object or array using fine-grained reactivity will cause it to re-fire (demo):


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let message = $state('hello');

	$inspect(count, message); // will console.log when `count` or `message` change
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>Increment</button>
<input bind:value={message} />
On updates, a stack trace will be printed, making it easy to find the origin of a state change (unless you’re in the playground, due to technical limitations).

$inspect(...).with
$inspect returns a property with, which you can invoke with a callback, which will then be invoked instead of console.log. The first argument to the callback is either "init" or "update"; subsequent arguments are the values passed to $inspect (demo):


<script>
	let count = $state(0);

	$inspect(count).with((type, count) => {
		if (type === 'update') {
			debugger; // or `console.trace`, or whatever you want
		}
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>Increment</button>
$inspect.trace(...)
This rune, added in 5.14, causes the surrounding function to be traced in development. Any time the function re-runs as part of an effect or a derived, information will be printed to the console about which pieces of reactive state caused the effect to fire.


<script>
	import { doSomeWork } from './elsewhere';

	$effect(() => {
		// $inspect.trace must be the first statement of a function body
		$inspect.trace();
		doSomeWork();
	});
</script>
$inspect.trace takes an optional first argument which will be used as the label.

	function dispatch(type) {

Tags
Element attributes
Component props
Spread attributes
Events
Text expressions
Comments
Markup inside a Svelte component can be thought of as HTML++.

Tags
A lowercase tag, like <div>, denotes a regular HTML element. A capitalised tag or a tag that uses dot notation, such as <Widget> or <my.stuff>, indicates a component.


<script>
	import Widget from './Widget.svelte';
</script>

<div>
	<Widget />
</div>
Element attributes
By default, attributes work exactly like their HTML counterparts.


<div class="foo">
	<button disabled>can't touch this</button>
</div>
As in HTML, values may be unquoted.


<input type=checkbox />
Attribute values can contain JavaScript expressions.


<a href="page/{p}">page {p}</a>
Or they can be JavaScript expressions.


<button disabled={!clickable}>...</button>
Boolean attributes are included on the element if their value is truthy and excluded if it’s falsy.

All other attributes are included unless their value is nullish (null or undefined).


<input required={false} placeholder="This input field is not required" />
<div title={null}>This div has no title attribute</div>
Quoting a singular expression does not affect how the value is parsed, but in Svelte 6 it will cause the value to be coerced to a string:


<button disabled="{number !== 42}">...</button>
When the attribute name and value match (name={name}), they can be replaced with {name}.


<button {disabled}>...</button>
<!-- equivalent to
<button disabled={disabled}>...</button>
-->
Component props
By convention, values passed to components are referred to as properties or props rather than attributes, which are a feature of the DOM.

As with elements, name={name} can be replaced with the {name} shorthand.


<Widget foo={bar} answer={42} text="hello" />
Spread attributes
Spread attributes allow many attributes or properties to be passed to an element or component at once.

An element or component can have multiple spread attributes, interspersed with regular ones. Order matters — if things.a exists it will take precedence over a="b", while c="d" would take precedence over things.c:


<Widget a="b" {...things} c="d" />
Events
Listening to DOM events is possible by adding attributes to the element that start with on. For example, to listen to the click event, add the onclick attribute to a button:


<button onclick={() => console.log('clicked')}>click me</button>
Event attributes are case sensitive. onclick listens to the click event, onClick listens to the Click event, which is different. This ensures you can listen to custom events that have uppercase characters in them.

Because events are just attributes, the same rules as for attributes apply:

you can use the shorthand form: <button {onclick}>click me</button>
you can spread them: <button {...thisSpreadContainsEventAttributes}>click me</button>
Timing-wise, event attributes always fire after events from bindings (e.g. oninput always fires after an update to bind:value). Under the hood, some event handlers are attached directly with addEventListener, while others are delegated.

When using ontouchstart and ontouchmove event attributes, the handlers are passive for better performance. This greatly improves responsiveness by allowing the browser to scroll the document immediately, rather than waiting to see if the event handler calls event.preventDefault().

In the very rare cases that you need to prevent these event defaults, you should use on instead (for example inside an action).

Event delegation
To reduce memory footprint and increase performance, Svelte uses a technique called event delegation. This means that for certain events — see the list below — a single event listener at the application root takes responsibility for running any handlers on the event’s path.

There are a few gotchas to be aware of:

when you manually dispatch an event with a delegated listener, make sure to set the { bubbles: true } option or it won’t reach the application root
when using addEventListener directly, avoid calling stopPropagation or the event won’t reach the application root and handlers won’t be invoked. Similarly, handlers added manually inside the application root will run before handlers added declaratively deeper in the DOM (with e.g. onclick={...}), in both capturing and bubbling phases. For these reasons it’s better to use the on function imported from svelte/events rather than addEventListener, as it will ensure that order is preserved and stopPropagation is handled correctly.
The following event handlers are delegated:

beforeinput
click
change
dblclick
contextmenu
focusin
focusout
input
keydown
keyup
mousedown
mousemove
mouseout
mouseover
mouseup
pointerdown
pointermove
pointerout
pointerover
pointerup
touchend
touchmove
touchstart
Text expressions
A JavaScript expression can be included as text by surrounding it with curly braces.


{expression}
Expressions that are null or undefined will be omitted; all others are coerced to strings.

Curly braces can be included in a Svelte template by using their HTML entity strings: &lbrace;, &lcub;, or &#123; for { and &rbrace;, &rcub;, or &#125; for }.

If you’re using a regular expression (RegExp) literal notation, you’ll need to wrap it in parentheses.


<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}.</p>

<div>{(/^[A-Za-z ]+$/).test(value) ? x : y}</div>
The expression will be stringified and escaped to prevent code injections. If you want to render HTML, use the {@html} tag instead.


{@html potentiallyUnsafeHtmlString}
Make sure that you either escape the passed string or only populate it with values that are under your control in order to prevent XSS attacks

Comments
You can use HTML comments inside components.


<!-- this is a comment! --><h1>Hello world</h1>
Comments beginning with svelte-ignore disable warnings for the next block of markup. Usually, these are accessibility warnings; make sure that you’re disabling them for a good reason.


<!-- svelte-ignore a11y_autofocus -->
<input bind:value={name} autofocus />
You can add a special comment starting with @component that will show up when hovering over the component name in other files.


<!--
@component

Keyed each blocks
Each blocks without an item
Else blocks
{#each expression as name}...{/each}
{#each expression as name, index}...{/each}
Iterating over values can be done with an each block. The values in question can be arrays, array-like objects (i.e. anything with a length property), or iterables like Map and Set — in other words, anything that can be used with Array.from.


<h1>Shopping list</h1>
<ul>
	{#each items as item}
		<li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li>
	{/each}
</ul>
An each block can also specify an index, equivalent to the second argument in an array.map(...) callback:


{#each items as item, i}
	<li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li>
{/each}
Keyed each blocks
{#each expression as name (key)}...{/each}
{#each expression as name, index (key)}...{/each}
If a key expression is provided — which must uniquely identify each list item — Svelte will use it to intelligently update the list when data changes by inserting, moving and deleting items, rather than adding or removing items at the end and updating the state in the middle.

The key can be any object, but strings and numbers are recommended since they allow identity to persist when the objects themselves change.


{#each items as item (item.id)}
	<li>{item.name} x {item.qty}</li>
{/each}

<!-- or with additional index value -->
{#each items as item, i (item.id)}
	<li>{i + 1}: {item.name} x {item.qty}</li>
{/each}
You can freely use destructuring and rest patterns in each blocks.


{#each items as { id, name, qty }, i (id)}
	<li>{i + 1}: {name} x {qty}</li>
{/each}

{#each objects as { id, ...rest }}
	<li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent {...rest} /></li>
{/each}

{#each items as [id, ...rest]}
	<li><span>{id}</span><MyComponent values={rest} /></li>
{/each}
Each blocks without an item
{#each expression}...{/each}
{#each expression, index}...{/each}
In case you just want to render something n times, you can omit the as part (demo):


<div class="chess-board">
	{#each { length: 8 }, rank}
		{#each { length: 8 }, file}
			<div class:black={(rank + file) % 2 === 1}></div>
		{/each}
	{/each}
</div>
Else blocks
{#each expression as name}...{:else}...{/each}
An each block can also have an {:else} clause, which is rendered if the list is empty.


{#each todos as todo}
	<p>{todo.text}</p>
{:else}
	<p>No tasks today!</p>
{/each}

Await blocks allow you to branch on the three possible states of a Promise — pending, fulfilled or rejected.


{#await promise}
	<!-- promise is pending -->

{:then value}
	<!-- promise was fulfilled or not a Promise -->
	<p>The value is {value}</p>
{:catch error}
	<!-- promise was rejected -->
	<p>Something went wrong: {error.message}</p>
{/await}
During server-side rendering, only the pending branch will be rendered.

If the provided expression is not a Promise, only the :then branch will be rendered, including during server-side rendering.

The catch block can be omitted if you don’t need to render anything when the promise rejects (or no error is possible).


{#await promise}
	<!-- promise is pending -->
	<p>waiting for the promise to resolve...</p>
{:then value}
	<!-- promise was fulfilled -->
	<p>The value is {value}</p>
{/await}
If you don’t care about the pending state, you can also omit the initial block.


{#await promise then value}
	<p>The value is {value}</p>
{/await}
Similarly, if you only want to show the error state, you can omit the then block.


{#await promise catch error}
	<p>The error is {error}</p>

{#snippet name()}...{/snippet}
{#snippet name(param1, param2, paramN)}...{/snippet}
Snippets, and render tags, are a way to create reusable chunks of markup inside your components. Instead of writing duplicative code like this...


{#each images as image}
	{#if image.href}
		<a href={image.href}>
			<figure>
				<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />
				<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</a>
	{:else}
		<figure>
			<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />
			<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>
		</figure>
	{/if}
{/each}
...you can write this:


{#snippet figure(image)}
	<figure>
		<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />
		<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>
	</figure>
{/snippet}

{#each images as image}
	{#if image.href}
		<a href={image.href}>
			{@render figure(image)}
		</a>
	{:else}
		{@render figure(image)}
	{/if}
{/each}
Like function declarations, snippets can have an arbitrary number of parameters, which can have default values, and you can destructure each parameter. You cannot use rest parameters, however.

Snippet scope
Snippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the <script> tag or in {#each ...} blocks (demo)...


<script>
	let { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();
</script>

{#snippet hello(name)}
	<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>
{/snippet}

{@render hello('alice')}
{@render hello('bob')}
...and they are ‘visible’ to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):


<div>
	{#snippet x()}
		{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}

		<!-- this is fine -->
		{@render y()}
	{/snippet}

	<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->
	{@render y()}
</div>

<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->
{@render x()}
Snippets can reference themselves and each other (demo):


{#snippet blastoff()}
	<span>🚀</span>
{/snippet}

{#snippet countdown(n)}
	{#if n > 0}
		<span>{n}...</span>
		{@render countdown(n - 1)}
	{:else}
		{@render blastoff()}
	{/if}
{/snippet}

{@render countdown(10)}
Passing snippets to components
Explicit props
Within the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props (demo):


<script>
	import Table from './Table.svelte';

	const fruits = [
		{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },
		{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },
		{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }
	];
</script>

{#snippet header()}
	<th>fruit</th>
	<th>qty</th>
	<th>price</th>
	<th>total</th>
{/snippet}

{#snippet row(d)}
	<td>{d.name}</td>
	<td>{d.qty}</td>
	<td>{d.price}</td>
	<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>
{/snippet}

<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />
Think about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.

Implicit props
As an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly inside a component implicitly become props on the component (demo):


<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->
<Table data={fruits}>
	{#snippet header()}
		<th>fruit</th>
		<th>qty</th>
		<th>price</th>
		<th>total</th>
	{/snippet}

	{#snippet row(d)}
		<td>{d.name}</td>
		<td>{d.qty}</td>
		<td>{d.price}</td>
		<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>
	{/snippet}
</Table>
Implicit children snippet
Any content inside the component tags that is not a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the children snippet (demo):

App

<Button>click me</Button>
Button

<script lang="ts">
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->
<button>{@render children()}</button>
Note that you cannot have a prop called children if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name

Optional snippet props
You can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn’t set...


<script>
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

{@render children?.()}
...or use an #if block to render fallback content:


<script>
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

{#if children}
	{@render children()}
{:else}
	fallback content
{/if}
Typing snippets
Snippets implement the Snippet interface imported from 'svelte':


<script lang="ts">
	import type { Snippet } from 'svelte';

	interface Props {
		data: any[];
		children: Snippet;
		row: Snippet<[any]>;
	}

	let { data, children, row }: Props = $props();
</script>
With this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a data prop and a row snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to Snippet is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.

We can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that data and row refer to the same type:


<script lang="ts" generics="T">
	import type { Snippet } from 'svelte';

	let {
		data,
		children,
		row
	}: {
		data: T[];
		children: Snippet;
		row: Snippet<[T]>;
	} = $props();
</script>
Exporting snippets
Snippets declared at the top level of a .svelte file can be exported from a <script module> for use in other components, provided they don’t reference any declarations in a non-module <script> (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) (demo):


<script module>
	export { add };
</script>

{#snippet add(a, b)}
	{a} + {b} = {a + b}
{/snippet}
This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer

Programmatic snippets
Snippets can be created programmatically with the createRawSnippet API. This is intended for advanced use cases.

Snippets and slots
In Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using slots. Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.

Optional snippets
To render a snippet, use a {@render ...} tag.


{#snippet sum(a, b)}
	<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
{/snippet}

{@render sum(1, 2)}
{@render sum(3, 4)}
{@render sum(5, 6)}
The expression can be an identifier like sum, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:


{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}
Optional snippets
If the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it’s an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it is defined:


{@render children?.()}
Alternatively, use an {#if ...} block with an :else clause to render fallback content:


{#if children}
	{@render children()}
{:else}
	<p>fallback content</p>

Styling
To inject raw HTML into your component, use the {@html ...} tag:


<article>
	{@html content}
</article>
Make sure that you either escape the passed string or only populate it with values that are under your control in order to prevent XSS attacks. Never render unsanitized content.

The expression should be valid standalone HTML — this will not work, because </div> is not valid HTML:


{@html '<div>'}content{@html '</div>'}
It also will not compile Svelte code.

Styling
Content rendered this way is ‘invisible’ to Svelte and as such will not receive scoped styles. In other words, this will not work, and the a and img styles will be regarded as unused:


<article>
	{@html content}
</article>

<style>
	article {
		a { color: hotpink }
		img { width: 100% }
	}
</style>
Instead, use the :global modifier to target everything inside the <article>:


<style>
	article :global {
		a { color: hotpink }
		img { width: 100% }
	}
</style>

Attachment factories
Inline attachments
Passing attachments to components
Controlling when attachments re-run
Creating attachments programmatically
Converting actions to attachments
Attachments are functions that run in an effect when an element is mounted to the DOM or when state read inside the function updates.

Optionally, they can return a function that is called before the attachment re-runs, or after the element is later removed from the DOM.

Attachments are available in Svelte 5.29 and newer.

App

<script lang="ts">
	import type { Attachment } from 'svelte/attachments';

	const myAttachment: Attachment = (element) => {
		console.log(element.nodeName); // 'DIV'

		return () => {
			console.log('cleaning up');
		};
	};
</script>

<div {@attach myAttachment}>...</div>
An element can have any number of attachments.

Attachment factories
A useful pattern is for a function, such as tooltip in this example, to return an attachment (demo):

App

<script lang="ts">
	import tippy from 'tippy.js';
	import type { Attachment } from 'svelte/attachments';

	let content = $state('Hello!');

	function tooltip(content: string): Attachment {
		return (element) => {
			const tooltip = tippy(element, { content });
			return tooltip.destroy;
		};
	}
</script>

<input bind:value={content} />

<button {@attach tooltip(content)}>
	Hover me
</button>
Since the tooltip(content) expression runs inside an effect, the attachment will be destroyed and recreated whenever content changes. The same thing would happen for any state read inside the attachment function when it first runs. (If this isn’t what you want, see Controlling when attachments re-run.)

Inline attachments
Attachments can also be created inline (demo):

App

<canvas
	width={32}
	height={32}
	{@attach (canvas) => {
		const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

		$effect(() => {
			context.fillStyle = color;
			context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
		});
	}}
></canvas>
The nested effect runs whenever color changes, while the outer effect (where canvas.getContext(...) is called) only runs once, since it doesn’t read any reactive state.

Passing attachments to components
When used on a component, {@attach ...} will create a prop whose key is a Symbol. If the component then spreads props onto an element, the element will receive those attachments.

This allows you to create wrapper components that augment elements (demo):

Button

<script lang="ts">
	import type { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements';

	let { children, ...props }: HTMLButtonAttributes = $props();
</script>

<!-- `props` includes attachments -->
<button {...props}>
	{@render children?.()}
</button>
App

<script lang="ts">
	import tippy from 'tippy.js';
	import Button from './Button.svelte';
	import type { Attachment } from 'svelte/attachments';

	let content = $state('Hello!');

	function tooltip(content: string): Attachment {
		return (element) => {
			const tooltip = tippy(element, { content });
			return tooltip.destroy;
		};
	}
</script>

<input bind:value={content} />

<Button {@attach tooltip(content)}>
	Hover me
</Button>
Controlling when attachments re-run
Attachments, unlike actions, are fully reactive: {@attach foo(bar)} will re-run on changes to foo or bar (or any state read inside foo):


function foo(bar) {
	return (node) => {
		veryExpensiveSetupWork(node);
		update(node, bar);
	};
}
In the rare case that this is a problem (for example, if foo does expensive and unavoidable setup work) consider passing the data inside a function and reading it in a child effect:


function foo(getBar) {
	return (node) => {
		veryExpensiveSetupWork(node);

		$effect(() => {
			update(node, getBar());
		});
	}
}
Creating attachments programmatically
To add attachments to an object that will be spread onto a component or element, use createAttachmentKey.

Converting actions to attachments
If you’re using a library that only provides actions, you can convert them to attachments with fromAction, allowing you to (for example) use them with components.

bind:this
bind:property for components
Data ordinarily flows down, from parent to child. The bind: directive allows data to flow the other way, from child to parent.

The general syntax is bind:property={expression}, where expression is an lvalue (i.e. a variable or an object property). When the expression is an identifier with the same name as the property, we can omit the expression — in other words these are equivalent:


<input bind:value={value} />
<input bind:value />
Svelte creates an event listener that updates the bound value. If an element already has a listener for the same event, that listener will be fired before the bound value is updated.

Most bindings are two-way, meaning that changes to the value will affect the element and vice versa. A few bindings are readonly, meaning that changing their value will have no effect on the element.

Function bindings
You can also use bind:property={get, set}, where get and set are functions, allowing you to perform validation and transformation:


<input bind:value={
	() => value,
	(v) => value = v.toLowerCase()}
/>
In the case of readonly bindings like dimension bindings, the get value should be null:


<div
	bind:clientWidth={null, redraw}
	bind:clientHeight={null, redraw}
>...</div>
Function bindings are available in Svelte 5.9.0 and newer.

<input bind:value>
A bind:value directive on an <input> element binds the input’s value property:


<script>
	let message = $state('hello');
</script>

<input bind:value={message} />
<p>{message}</p>
In the case of a numeric input (type="number" or type="range"), the value will be coerced to a number (demo):


<script>
	let a = $state(1);
	let b = $state(2);
</script>

<label>
	<input type="number" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={a} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<label>
	<input type="number" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
	<input type="range" bind:value={b} min="0" max="10" />
</label>

<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
If the input is empty or invalid (in the case of type="number"), the value is undefined.

Since 5.6.0, if an <input> has a defaultValue and is part of a form, it will revert to that value instead of the empty string when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence unless it is null or undefined.


<script>
	let value = $state('');
</script>

<form>
	<input bind:value defaultValue="not the empty string">
	<input type="reset" value="Reset">
</form>
Use reset buttons sparingly, and ensure that users won’t accidentally click them while trying to submit the form.

<input bind:checked>
Checkbox inputs can be bound with bind:checked:


<label>
	<input type="checkbox" bind:checked={accepted} />
	Accept terms and conditions
</label>
Since 5.6.0, if an <input> has a defaultChecked attribute and is part of a form, it will revert to that value instead of false when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence unless it is null or undefined.


<script>
	let checked = $state(true);
</script>

<form>
	<input type="checkbox" bind:checked defaultChecked={true}>
	<input type="reset" value="Reset">
</form>
Use bind:group for radio inputs instead of bind:checked.

<input bind:indeterminate>
Checkboxes can be in an indeterminate state, independently of whether they are checked or unchecked:


<script>
	let checked = $state(false);
	let indeterminate = $state(true);
</script>

<form>
	<input type="checkbox" bind:checked bind:indeterminate>

	{#if indeterminate}
		waiting...
	{:else if checked}
		checked
	{:else}
		unchecked
	{/if}
</form>
<input bind:group>
Inputs that work together can use bind:group (demo):

BurritoChooser

<script lang="ts">
	let tortilla = $state('Plain');
	let fillings: string[] = $state([]);
</script>

<!-- grouped radio inputs are mutually exclusive -->
<label><input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Plain" /> Plain</label>
<label><input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Whole wheat" /> Whole wheat</label>
<label><input type="radio" bind:group={tortilla} value="Spinach" /> Spinach</label>

<!-- grouped checkbox inputs populate an array -->
<label><input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Rice" /> Rice</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Beans" /> Beans</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Cheese" /> Cheese</label>
<label><input type="checkbox" bind:group={fillings} value="Guac (extra)" /> Guac (extra)</label>
bind:group only works if the inputs are in the same Svelte component.

<input bind:files>
On <input> elements with type="file", you can use bind:files to get the FileList of selected files. When you want to update the files programmatically, you always need to use a FileList object. Currently FileList objects cannot be constructed directly, so you need to create a new DataTransfer object and get files from there.


<script>
	let files = $state();

	function clear() {
		files = new DataTransfer().files; // null or undefined does not work
	}
</script>

<label for="avatar">Upload a picture:</label>
<input accept="image/png, image/jpeg" bind:files id="avatar" name="avatar" type="file" />
<button onclick={clear}>clear</button>
FileList objects also cannot be modified, so if you want to e.g. delete a single file from the list, you need to create a new DataTransfer object and add the files you want to keep.

DataTransfer may not be available in server-side JS runtimes. Leaving the state that is bound to files uninitialized prevents potential errors if components are server-side rendered.

<select bind:value>
A <select> value binding corresponds to the value property on the selected <option>, which can be any value (not just strings, as is normally the case in the DOM).


<select bind:value={selected}>
	<option value={a}>a</option>
	<option value={b}>b</option>
	<option value={c}>c</option>
</select>
A <select multiple> element behaves similarly to a checkbox group. The bound variable is an array with an entry corresponding to the value property of each selected <option>.


<select multiple bind:value={fillings}>
	<option value="Rice">Rice</option>
	<option value="Beans">Beans</option>
	<option value="Cheese">Cheese</option>
	<option value="Guac (extra)">Guac (extra)</option>
</select>
When the value of an <option> matches its text content, the attribute can be omitted.


<select multiple bind:value={fillings}>
	<option>Rice</option>
	<option>Beans</option>
	<option>Cheese</option>
	<option>Guac (extra)</option>
</select>
You can give the <select> a default value by adding a selected attribute to the<option> (or options, in the case of <select multiple>) that should be initially selected. If the <select> is part of a form, it will revert to that selection when the form is reset. Note that for the initial render the value of the binding takes precedence if it’s not undefined.


<select bind:value={selected}>
	<option value={a}>a</option>
	<option value={b} selected>b</option>
	<option value={c}>c</option>
</select>
<audio>
<audio> elements have their own set of bindings — five two-way ones...

currentTime
playbackRate
paused
volume
muted
...and six readonly ones:

duration
buffered
seekable
seeking
ended
readyState
played

<audio src={clip} bind:duration bind:currentTime bind:paused></audio>
<video>
<video> elements have all the same bindings as <audio> elements, plus readonly videoWidth and videoHeight bindings.

<img>
<img> elements have two readonly bindings:

naturalWidth
naturalHeight
<details bind:open>
<details> elements support binding to the open property.


<details bind:open={isOpen}>
	<summary>How do you comfort a JavaScript bug?</summary>
	<p>You console it.</p>
</details>
window and document
To bind to properties of window and document, see <svelte:window> and <svelte:document>.

Contenteditable bindings
Elements with the contenteditable attribute support the following bindings:

innerHTML
innerText
textContent
There are subtle differences between innerText and textContent.


<div contenteditable="true" bind:innerHTML={html}></div>
Dimensions
All visible elements have the following readonly bindings, measured with a ResizeObserver:

clientWidth
clientHeight
offsetWidth
offsetHeight
contentRect
contentBoxSize
borderBoxSize
devicePixelContentBoxSize

<div bind:offsetWidth={width} bind:offsetHeight={height}>
	<Chart {width} {height} />
</div>
display: inline elements do not have a width or height (except for elements with ‘intrinsic’ dimensions, like <img> and <canvas>), and cannot be observed with a ResizeObserver. You will need to change the display style of these elements to something else, such as inline-block. Note that CSS transformations do not trigger ResizeObserver callbacks.

bind:this
bind:this={dom_node}
To get a reference to a DOM node, use bind:this. The value will be undefined until the component is mounted — in other words, you should read it inside an effect or an event handler, but not during component initialisation:


<script>
	/** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */
	let canvas;

	$effect(() => {
		const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
		drawStuff(ctx);
	});
</script>

<canvas bind:this={canvas}></canvas>
Components also support bind:this, allowing you to interact with component instances programmatically.

App

<ShoppingCart bind:this={cart} />

<button onclick={() => cart.empty()}> Empty shopping cart </button>
ShoppingCart

<script lang="ts">
	// All instance exports are available on the instance object
	export function empty() {
		// ...
	}
</script>
In case of using the function bindings, the getter is required to ensure that the correct value is nullified on component or element destruction.

bind:property for components

bind:property={variable}
You can bind to component props using the same syntax as for elements.


<Keypad bind:value={pin} />
While Svelte props are reactive without binding, that reactivity only flows downward into the component by default. Using bind:property allows changes to the property from within the component to flow back up out of the component.

To mark a property as bindable, use the $bindable rune:


<script>
	let { readonlyProperty, bindableProperty = $bindable() } = $props();
</script>
Declaring a property as bindable means it can be used using bind:, not that it must be used using bind:.

Bindable properties can have a fallback value:


<script>
	let { bindableProperty = $bindable('fallback value') } = $props();
</script>
This fallback value only applies when the property is not bound. When the property is bound and a fallback value is present, the parent is expected to provide a value other than undefined, else a runtime error is thrown. This prevents hard-to-reason-about situations where it’s unclear which value should apply.

Typing
In Svelte 5.29 and newer, consider using attachments instead, as they are more flexible and composable.

Actions are functions that are called when an element is mounted. They are added with the use: directive, and will typically use an $effect so that they can reset any state when the element is unmounted:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import type { Action } from 'svelte/action';

	const myaction: Action = (node) => {
		// the node has been mounted in the DOM

		$effect(() => {
			// setup goes here

			return () => {
				// teardown goes here
			};
		});
	};
</script>

<div use:myaction>...</div>
An action can be called with an argument:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import type { Action } from 'svelte/action';

	const myaction: Action = (node, data) => {
		// ...
	};
</script>

<div use:myaction={data}>...</div>
The action is only called once (but not during server-side rendering) — it will not run again if the argument changes.

Prior to the $effect rune, actions could return an object with update and destroy methods, where update would be called with the latest value of the argument if it changed. Using effects is preferred.

Typing
The Action interface receives three optional type arguments — a node type (which can be Element, if the action applies to everything), a parameter, and any custom event handlers created by the action:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import type { Action } from 'svelte/action';

	const gestures: Action<
		HTMLDivElement,
		undefined,
		{
			onswiperight: (e: CustomEvent) => void;
			onswipeleft: (e: CustomEvent) => void;
			// ...
		}
	> = (node) => {
		$effect(() => {
			// ...
			node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('swipeleft'));

			// ...
			node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('swiperight'));
		});
	};
</script>

<div

transition:
Local vs global
Built-in transitions
Transition parameters
Custom transition functions
Transition events
A transition is triggered by an element entering or leaving the DOM as a result of a state change.

When a block (such as an {#if ...} block) is transitioning out, all elements inside it, including those that do not have their own transitions, are kept in the DOM until every transition in the block has been completed.

The transition: directive indicates a bidirectional transition, which means it can be smoothly reversed while the transition is in progress.


<script>
	import { fade } from 'svelte/transition';

	let visible = $state(false);
</script>

<button onclick={() => visible = !visible}>toggle</button>

{#if visible}
	<div transition:fade>fades in and out</div>
{/if}
Local vs global
Transitions are local by default. Local transitions only play when the block they belong to is created or destroyed, not when parent blocks are created or destroyed.


{#if x}
	{#if y}
		<p transition:fade>fades in and out only when y changes</p>

		<p transition:fade|global>fades in and out when x or y change</p>
	{/if}
{/if}
Built-in transitions
A selection of built-in transitions can be imported from the svelte/transition module.

Transition parameters
Transitions can have parameters.

(The double {{curlies}} aren’t a special syntax; this is an object literal inside an expression tag.)


{#if visible}
	<div transition:fade={{ duration: 2000 }}>fades in and out over two seconds</div>
{/if}
Custom transition functions
transition = (node: HTMLElement, params: any, options: { direction: 'in' | 'out' | 'both' }) => {
	delay?: number,
	duration?: number,
	easing?: (t: number) => number,
	css?: (t: number, u: number) => string,
	tick?: (t: number, u: number) => void
}
Transitions can use custom functions. If the returned object has a css function, Svelte will generate keyframes for a web animation.

The t argument passed to css is a value between 0 and 1 after the easing function has been applied. In transitions run from 0 to 1, out transitions run from 1 to 0 — in other words, 1 is the element’s natural state, as though no transition had been applied. The u argument is equal to 1 - t.

The function is called repeatedly before the transition begins, with different t and u arguments.

App

<script lang="ts">
	import { elasticOut } from 'svelte/easing';
	export let visible: boolean;

	function whoosh(node: HTMLElement, params: { delay?: number, duration?: number, easing?: (t: number) => number }) {
		const existingTransform = getComputedStyle(node).transform.replace('none', '');

		return {
			delay: params.delay || 0,
			duration: params.duration || 400,
			easing: params.easing || elasticOut,
			css: (t, u) => `transform: ${existingTransform} scale(${t})`
		};
	}
</script>

{#if visible}
	<div in:whoosh>whooshes in</div>

A custom transition function can also return a tick function, which is called during the transition with the same t and u arguments.

If it’s possible to use css instead of tick, do so — web animations can run off the main thread, preventing jank on slower devices.

App

<script lang="ts">
	export let visible = false;

	function typewriter(node: HTMLElement, { speed = 1 }: { speed?: number }) {
		const valid = node.childNodes.length === 1 && node.childNodes[0].nodeType === Node.TEXT_NODE;

		if (!valid) {
			throw new Error(`This transition only works on elements with a single text node child`);
		}

		const text = node.textContent;
		const duration = text.length / (speed * 0.01);

		return {
			duration,
			tick: (t) => {
				const i = ~~(text.length * t);
				node.textContent = text.slice(0, i);
			}
		};
	}
</script>

{#if visible}
	<p in:typewriter={{ speed: 1 }}>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
{/if}
If a transition returns a function instead of a transition object, the function will be called in the next microtask. This allows multiple transitions to coordinate, making crossfade effects possible.

Transition functions also receive a third argument, options, which contains information about the transition.

Available values in the options object are:

direction - one of in, out, or both depending on the type of transition
Transition events
An element with transitions will dispatch the following events in addition to any standard DOM events:

introstart
introend
outrostart
outroend

{#if visible}
	<p
		transition:fly={{ y: 200, duration: 2000 }}
		onintrostart={() => (status = 'intro started')}
		onoutrostart={() => (status = 'outro started')}
		onintroend={() => (status = 'intro ended')}
		onoutroend={() => (status = 'outro ended')}
	>
		Flies in and out
	</p>
{/if}

The in: and out: directives are identical to transition:, except that the resulting transitions are not bidirectional — an in transition will continue to ‘play’ alongside the out transition, rather than reversing, if the block is outroed while the transition is in progress. If an out transition is aborted, transitions will restart from scratch.

Animation Parameters
Custom animation functions
An animation is triggered when the contents of a keyed each block are re-ordered. Animations do not run when an element is added or removed, only when the index of an existing data item within the each block changes. Animate directives must be on an element that is an immediate child of a keyed each block.

Animations can be used with Svelte’s built-in animation functions or custom animation functions.


<!-- When `list` is reordered the animation will run -->
{#each list as item, index (item)}
	<li animate:flip>{item}</li>
{/each}
Animation Parameters
As with actions and transitions, animations can have parameters.

(The double {{curlies}} aren’t a special syntax; this is an object literal inside an expression tag.)


{#each list as item, index (item)}
	<li animate:flip={{ delay: 500 }}>{item}</li>
{/each}
Custom animation functions
animation = (node: HTMLElement, { from: DOMRect, to: DOMRect } , params: any) => {
	delay?: number,
	duration?: number,
	easing?: (t: number) => number,
	css?: (t: number, u: number) => string,
	tick?: (t: number, u: number) => void
}
Animations can use custom functions that provide the node, an animation object and any parameters as arguments. The animation parameter is an object containing from and to properties each containing a DOMRect describing the geometry of the element in its start and end positions. The from property is the DOMRect of the element in its starting position, and the to property is the DOMRect of the element in its final position after the list has been reordered and the DOM updated.

If the returned object has a css method, Svelte will create a web animation that plays on the element.

The t argument passed to css is a value that goes from 0 and 1 after the easing function has been applied. The u argument is equal to 1 - t.

The function is called repeatedly before the animation begins, with different t and u arguments.

App

<script lang="ts">
	import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing';

	function whizz(node: HTMLElement, { from, to }: { from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }, params: any) {
		const dx = from.left - to.left;
		const dy = from.top - to.top;

		const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

		return {
			delay: 0,
			duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120,
			easing: cubicOut,
			css: (t, u) => `transform: translate(${u * dx}px, ${u * dy}px) rotate(${t * 360}deg);`
		};
	}
</script>

{#each list as item, index (item)}
	<div animate:whizz>{item}</div>
{/each}
A custom animation function can also return a tick function, which is called during the animation with the same t and u arguments.

If it’s possible to use css instead of tick, do so — web animations can run off the main thread, preventing jank on slower devices.

App

<script lang="ts">
	import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing';

	function whizz(node: HTMLElement, { from, to }: { from: DOMRect; to: DOMRect }, params: any) {
		const dx = from.left - to.left;
		const dy = from.top - to.top;

		const d = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

		return {
			delay: 0,
			duration: Math.sqrt(d) * 120,
			easing: cubicOut,
			tick: (t, u) => Object.assign(node.style, { color: t > 0.5 ? 'Pink' : 'Blue' })
		};
	}
</script>

{#each list as item, index (item)}
	<div animate:whizz>{item}</div>
{/each}

style:
The style: directive provides a shorthand for setting multiple styles on an element.


<!-- These are equivalent -->
<div style:color="red">...</div>
<div style="color: red;">...</div>
The value can contain arbitrary expressions:


<div style:color={myColor}>...</div>
The shorthand form is allowed:


<div style:color>...</div>
Multiple styles can be set on a single element:


<div style:color style:width="12rem" style:background-color={darkMode ? 'black' : 'white'}>...</div>
To mark a style as important, use the |important modifier:


<div style:color|important="red">...</div>
When style: directives are combined with style attributes, the directives will take precedence, even over !important properties:


<div style:color="red" style="color: blue">This will be red</div>
<div style:color="red" style="color: blue !important">This will still be red</div>

Attributes
The class: directive
There are two ways to set classes on elements: the class attribute, and the class: directive.

Attributes
Primitive values are treated like any other attribute:


<div class={large ? 'large' : 'small'}>...</div>
For historical reasons, falsy values (like false and NaN) are stringified (class="false"), though class={undefined} (or null) cause the attribute to be omitted altogether. In a future version of Svelte, all falsy values will cause class to be omitted.

Objects and arrays
Since Svelte 5.16, class can be an object or array, and is converted to a string using clsx.

If the value is an object, the truthy keys are added:


<script>
	let { cool } = $props();
</script>

<!-- results in `class="cool"` if `cool` is truthy,
	 `class="lame"` otherwise -->
<div class={{ cool, lame: !cool }}>...</div>
If the value is an array, the truthy values are combined:


<!-- if `faded` and `large` are both truthy, results in
	 `class="saturate-0 opacity-50 scale-200"` -->
<div class={[faded && 'saturate-0 opacity-50', large && 'scale-200']}>...</div>
Note that whether we’re using the array or object form, we can set multiple classes simultaneously with a single condition, which is particularly useful if you’re using things like Tailwind.

Arrays can contain arrays and objects, and clsx will flatten them. This is useful for combining local classes with props, for example:

Button

<script lang="ts">
	let props = $props();
</script>

<button {...props} class={['cool-button', props.class]}>
	{@render props.children?.()}
</button>
The user of this component has the same flexibility to use a mixture of objects, arrays and strings:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Button from './Button.svelte';
	let useTailwind = $state(false);
</script>

<Button
	onclick={() => useTailwind = true}
	class={{ 'bg-blue-700 sm:w-1/2': useTailwind }}
>
	Accept the inevitability of Tailwind
</Button>
Since Svelte 5.19, Svelte also exposes the ClassValue type, which is the type of value that the class attribute on elements accept. This is useful if you want to use a type-safe class name in component props:


<script lang="ts">
	import type { ClassValue } from 'svelte/elements';

	const props: { class: ClassValue } = $props();
</script>

<div class={['original', props.class]}>...</div>
The class: directive
Prior to Svelte 5.16, the class: directive was the most convenient way to set classes on elements conditionally.


<!-- These are equivalent -->
<div class={{ cool, lame: !cool }}>...</div>
<div class:cool={cool} class:lame={!cool}>...</div>
As with other directives, we can use a shorthand when the name of the class coincides with the value:


<div class:cool class:lame={!cool}>...</div>
Unless you’re using an older version of Svelte, consider avoiding class:, since the attribute is more powerful and composable.

Synchronized updates
Concurrency
Indicating loading states
Error handling
Server-side rendering
Forking
Caveats
Breaking changes
As of Svelte 5.36, you can use the await keyword inside your components in three places where it was previously unavailable:

at the top level of your component’s <script>
inside $derived(...) declarations
inside your markup
This feature is currently experimental, and you must opt in by adding the experimental.async option wherever you configure Svelte, usually svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

export default {
	compilerOptions: {
		experimental: {
			async: true
		}
	}
};
The experimental flag will be removed in Svelte 6.

Synchronized updates
When an await expression depends on a particular piece of state, changes to that state will not be reflected in the UI until the asynchronous work has completed, so that the UI is not left in an inconsistent state. In other words, in an example like this...


<script>
	let a = $state(1);
	let b = $state(2);

	async function add(a, b) {
		await new Promise((f) => setTimeout(f, 500)); // artificial delay
		return a + b;
	}
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={a}>
<input type="number" bind:value={b}>

<p>{a} + {b} = {await add(a, b)}</p>
...if you increment a, the contents of the <p> will not immediately update to read this —


<p>2 + 2 = 3</p>
— instead, the text will update to 2 + 2 = 4 when add(a, b) resolves.

Updates can overlap — a fast update will be reflected in the UI while an earlier slow update is still ongoing.

Concurrency
Svelte will do as much asynchronous work as it can in parallel. For example if you have two await expressions in your markup...


<p>{await one()}</p>
<p>{await two()}</p>
...both functions will run at the same time, as they are independent expressions, even though they are visually sequential.

This does not apply to sequential await expressions inside your <script> or inside async functions — these run like any other asynchronous JavaScript. An exception is that independent $derived expressions will update independently, even though they will run sequentially when they are first created:


// these will run sequentially the first time,
// but will update independently
let a = $derived(await one());
let b = $derived(await two());
If you write code like this, expect Svelte to give you an await_waterfall warning

Indicating loading states
To render placeholder UI, you can wrap content in a <svelte:boundary> with a pending snippet. This will be shown when the boundary is first created, but not for subsequent updates, which are globally coordinated.

After the contents of a boundary have resolved for the first time and have replaced the pending snippet, you can detect subsequent async work with $effect.pending(). This is what you would use to display a “we’re asynchronously validating your input” spinner next to a form field, for example.

You can also use settled() to get a promise that resolves when the current update is complete:


import { tick, settled } from 'svelte';

async function onclick() {
	updating = true;

	// without this, the change to `updating` will be
	// grouped with the other changes, meaning it
	// won't be reflected in the UI
	await tick();

	color = 'octarine';
	answer = 42;

	await settled();

	// any updates affected by `color` or `answer`
	// have now been applied
	updating = false;
}
Error handling
Errors in await expressions will bubble to the nearest error boundary.

Server-side rendering
Svelte supports asynchronous server-side rendering (SSR) with the render(...) API. To use it, simply await the return value:

server

import { render } from 'svelte/server';
import App from './App.svelte';

const { head, body } = await render(App);
If you’re using a framework like SvelteKit, this is done on your behalf.

If a <svelte:boundary> with a pending snippet is encountered during SSR, that snippet will be rendered while the rest of the content is ignored. All await expressions encountered outside boundaries with pending snippets will resolve and render their contents prior to await render(...) returning.

In the future, we plan to add a streaming implementation that renders the content in the background.

Forking
The fork(...) API, added in 5.42, makes it possible to run await expressions that you expect to happen in the near future. This is mainly intended for frameworks like SvelteKit to implement preloading when (for example) users signal an intent to navigate.


<script>
	import { fork } from 'svelte';
	import Menu from './Menu.svelte';

	let open = $state(false);

	/** @type {import('svelte').Fork | null} */
	let pending = null;

	function preload() {
		pending ??= fork(() => {
			open = true;
		});
	}

	function discard() {
		pending?.discard();
		pending = null;
	}
</script>

<button
	onfocusin={preload}
	onfocusout={discard}
	onpointerenter={preload}
	onpointerleave={discard}
	onclick={() => {
		pending?.commit();
		pending = null;

		// in case `pending` didn't exist
		// (if it did, this is a no-op)
		open = true;
	}}
>open menu</button>

{#if open}
	<!-- any async work inside this component will start
	     as soon as the fork is created -->
	<Menu onclose={() => open = false} />
{/if}
Caveats
As an experimental feature, the details of how await is handled (and related APIs like $effect.pending()) are subject to breaking changes outside of a semver major release, though we intend to keep such changes to a bare minimum.

Breaking changes
Effects run in a slightly different order when the experimental.async option is true. Specifically, block effects like {#if ...} and {#each ...} now run before an $effect.pre or beforeUpdate in the same component, which means that in very rare situations it is possible to update a block that should no longer exist, but only if you update state inside an effect, which you should avoid.

Scoped styles
Specificity
Scoped keyframes
Svelte components can include a <style> element containing CSS that belongs to the component. This CSS is scoped by default, meaning that styles will not apply to any elements on the page outside the component in question.

This works by adding a class to affected elements, which is based on a hash of the component styles (e.g. svelte-123xyz).


<style>
	p {
		/* this will only affect <p> elements in this component */
		color: burlywood;
	}
</style>
Specificity
Each scoped selector receives a specificity increase of 0-1-0, as a result of the scoping class (e.g. .svelte-123xyz) being added to the selector. This means that (for example) a p selector defined in a component will take precedence over a p selector defined in a global stylesheet, even if the global stylesheet is loaded later.

In some cases, the scoping class must be added to a selector multiple times, but after the first occurrence it is added with :where(.svelte-xyz123) in order to not increase specificity further.

Scoped keyframes
If a component defines @keyframes, the name is scoped to the component using the same hashing approach. Any animation rules in the component will be similarly adjusted:


<style>
	.bouncy {
		animation: bounce 10s;
	}

	/* these keyframes are only accessible inside this component */
	@keyframes bounce {
		/* ... */
	}

:global(...)

:global(...)
To apply styles to a single selector globally, use the :global(...) modifier:


<style>
	:global(body) {
		/* applies to <body> */
		margin: 0;
	}

	div :global(strong) {
		/* applies to all <strong> elements, in any component,
		   that are inside <div> elements belonging
		   to this component */
		color: goldenrod;
	}

	p:global(.big.red) {
		/* applies to all <p> elements belonging to this component
		   with `class="big red"`, even if it is applied
		   programmatically (for example by a library) */
	}
</style>
If you want to make @keyframes that are accessible globally, you need to prepend your keyframe names with -global-.

The -global- part will be removed when compiled, and the keyframe will then be referenced using just my-animation-name elsewhere in your code.


<style>
	@keyframes -global-my-animation-name {
		/* code goes here */
	}
</style>
:global
To apply styles to a group of selectors globally, create a :global {...} block:


<style>
	:global {
		/* applies to every <div> in your application */
		div { ... }

		/* applies to every <p> in your application */
		p { ... }
	}

	.a :global {
		/* applies to every `.b .c .d` element, in any component,
		   that is inside an `.a` element in this component */
		.b .c .d {...}
	}
</style>
The second example above could also be written as an equivalent .a :global .b .c .d selector, where everything after the :global is unscoped, though the nested form is preferred.

Custom properties
You can pass CSS custom properties — both static and dynamic — to components:


<Slider
	bind:value
	min={0}
	max={100}
	--track-color="black"
	--thumb-color="rgb({r} {g} {b})"
/>
The above code essentially desugars to this:


<svelte-css-wrapper style="display: contents; --track-color: black; --thumb-color: rgb({r} {g} {b})">
	<Slider
		bind:value
		min={0}
		max={100}
	/>
</svelte-css-wrapper>
For an SVG element, it would use <g> instead:


<g style="--track-color: black; --thumb-color: rgb({r} {g} {b})">
	<Slider
		bind:value
		min={0}
		max={100}
	/>
</g>
Inside the component, we can read these custom properties (and provide fallback values) using var(...):


<style>
	.track {
		background: var(--track-color, #aaa);
	}

	.thumb {
		background: var(--thumb-color, blue);
	}
</style>
You don’t have to specify the values directly on the component; as long as the custom properties are defined on a parent element, the component can use them. It’s common to define custom properties on the :root element in a global stylesheet so that they apply to your entire application.

While the extra element will not affect layout, it will affect any CSS selectors that (for example) use the > combinator to target an element directly inside the component’s container.

There can only be one top-level <style> tag per component.

However, it is possible to have a <style> tag nested inside other elements or logic blocks.

In that case, the <style> tag will be inserted as-is into the DOM; no scoping or processing will be done on the <style> tag.

<svelte:boundary>
Properties

<svelte:boundary onerror={handler}>...</svelte:boundary>
This feature was added in 5.3.0

Boundaries allow you to ‘wall off’ parts of your app, so that you can:

provide UI that should be shown when await expressions are first resolving
handle errors that occur during rendering or while running effects, and provide UI that should be rendered when an error happens
If a boundary handles an error (with a failed snippet or onerror handler, or both) its existing content will be removed.

Errors occurring outside the rendering process (for example, in event handlers or after a setTimeout or async work) are not caught by error boundaries.

Properties
For the boundary to do anything, one or more of the following must be provided.

pending
This snippet will be shown when the boundary is first created, and will remain visible until all the await expressions inside the boundary have resolved (demo):


<svelte:boundary>
	<p>{await delayed('hello!')}</p>

	{#snippet pending()}
		<p>loading...</p>
	{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
The pending snippet will not be shown for subsequent async updates — for these, you can use $effect.pending().

In the playground, your app is rendered inside a boundary with an empty pending snippet, so that you can use await without having to create one.

failed
If a failed snippet is provided, it will be rendered when an error is thrown inside the boundary, with the error and a reset function that recreates the contents (demo):


<svelte:boundary>
	<FlakyComponent />

	{#snippet failed(error, reset)}
		<button onclick={reset}>oops! try again</button>
	{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
As with snippets passed to components, the failed snippet can be passed explicitly as a property...


<svelte:boundary {failed}>...</svelte:boundary>
...or implicitly by declaring it directly inside the boundary, as in the example above.

onerror
If an onerror function is provided, it will be called with the same two error and reset arguments. This is useful for tracking the error with an error reporting service...


<svelte:boundary onerror={(e) => report(e)}>
	...
</svelte:boundary>
...or using error and reset outside the boundary itself:


<script>
	let error = $state(null);
	let reset = $state(() => {});

	function onerror(e, r) {
		error = e;
		reset = r;
	}
</script>

<svelte:boundary {onerror}>
	<FlakyComponent />
</svelte:boundary>

{#if error}
	<button onclick={() => {
		error = null;
		reset();
	}}>
		oops! try again
	</button>
{/if}
If an error occurs inside the onerror function (or if you rethrow the error), it will be handled by a parent boundary if such exists.

The <svelte:window> element allows you to add event listeners to the window object without worrying about removing them when the component is destroyed, or checking for the existence of window when server-side rendering.

This element may only appear at the top level of your component — it cannot be inside a block or element.

Note that the page will not be scrolled to the initial value to avoid accessibility issues. Only subsequent changes to the bound variable of scrollX and scrollY will cause scrolling. If you have a legitimate reason to scroll when the component is rendered, call scrollTo() in an $effect.

Similarly to <svelte:window>, this element allows you to add listeners to events on document, such as visibilitychange, which don’t fire on window. It also lets you use actions on document.

As with <svelte:window>, this element may only appear the top level of your component and must never be inside a block or element.


<svelte:document onvisibilitychange={handleVisibilityChange} use:someAction />
You can also bind to the following properties:

activeElement
fullscreenElement
pointerLockElement
visibilityState
All are readonly.

<svelte:element this={expression} />
The <svelte:element> element lets you render an element that is unknown at author time, for example because it comes from a CMS. Any properties and event listeners present will be applied to the element.

The only supported binding is bind:this, since Svelte’s built-in bindings do not work with generic elements.

If this has a nullish value, the element and its children will not be rendered.

If this is the name of a void element (e.g., br) and <svelte:element> has child elements, a runtime error will be thrown in development mode:


<script>
	let tag = $state('hr');
</script>

<svelte:element this={tag}>
	This text cannot appear inside an hr element
</svelte:element>
Svelte tries its best to infer the correct namespace from the element’s surroundings, but it’s not always possible. You can make it explicit with an xmlns attribute:


<svelte:element this={tag} xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" />
this needs to be a valid DOM element tag, things like #text or svelte:head will not work.

The <svelte:options> element provides a place to specify per-component compiler options, which are detailed in the compiler section. The possible options are:

runes={true} — forces a component into runes mode (see the Legacy APIs section)
runes={false} — forces a component into legacy mode

customElement={...} — the options to use when compiling this component as a custom element. If a string is passed, it is used as the tag option
css="injected" — the component will inject its styles inline: During server-side rendering, it’s injected as a <style> tag in the head, during client side rendering, it’s loaded via JavaScript
Deprecated options Svelte 4 also included the following options. They are deprecated in Svelte 5 and non-functional in runes mode.

immutable={true} — you never use mutable data, so the compiler can do simple referential equality checks to determine if values have changed
immutable={false} — the default. Svelte will be more conservative about whether or not mutable objects have changed
accessors={true} — adds getters and setters for the component’s props
accessors={false} — the default

When to use stores
svelte/store
Store contract
A store is an object that allows reactive access to a value via a simple store contract. The svelte/store module contains minimal store implementations which fulfil this contract.

Any time you have a reference to a store, you can access its value inside a component by prefixing it with the $ character. This causes Svelte to declare the prefixed variable, subscribe to the store at component initialisation and unsubscribe when appropriate.

Assignments to $-prefixed variables require that the variable be a writable store, and will result in a call to the store’s .set method.

Note that the store must be declared at the top level of the component — not inside an if block or a function, for example.

Local variables (that do not represent store values) must not have a $ prefix.


<script>
	import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

	const count = writable(0);
	console.log($count); // logs 0

	count.set(1);
	console.log($count); // logs 1

	$count = 2;
	console.log($count); // logs 2
</script>
When to use stores
Prior to Svelte 5, stores were the go-to solution for creating cross-component reactive states or extracting logic. With runes, these use cases have greatly diminished.

when extracting logic, it’s better to take advantage of runes’ universal reactivity: You can use runes outside the top level of components and even place them into JavaScript or TypeScript files (using a .svelte.js or .svelte.ts file ending)
when creating shared state, you can create a $state object containing the values you need and then manipulate said state
state.svelte

export const userState = $state({
	name: 'name',
	/* ... */
});
App

<script lang="ts">
	import { userState } from './state.svelte.js';
</script>

<p>User name: {userState.name}</p>
<button onclick={() => {
	userState.name = 'new name';
}}>
	change name
</button>
Stores are still a good solution when you have complex asynchronous data streams or it’s important to have more manual control over updating values or listening to changes. If you’re familiar with RxJs and want to reuse that knowledge, the $ also comes in handy for you.

svelte/store
The svelte/store module contains a minimal store implementation which fulfil the store contract. It provides methods for creating stores that you can update from the outside, stores you can only update from the inside, and for combining and deriving stores.

writable
Function that creates a store which has values that can be set from ‘outside’ components. It gets created as an object with additional set and update methods.

set is a method that takes one argument which is the value to be set. The store value gets set to the value of the argument if the store value is not already equal to it.

update is a method that takes one argument which is a callback. The callback takes the existing store value as its argument and returns the new value to be set to the store.

store

import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const count = writable(0);

count.subscribe((value) => {
	console.log(value);
}); // logs '0'

count.set(1); // logs '1'

count.update((n) => n + 1); // logs '2'
If a function is passed as the second argument, it will be called when the number of subscribers goes from zero to one (but not from one to two, etc). That function will be passed a set function which changes the value of the store, and an update function which works like the update method on the store, taking a callback to calculate the store’s new value from its old value. It must return a stop function that is called when the subscriber count goes from one to zero.

store

import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const count = writable(0, () => {
	console.log('got a subscriber');
	return () => console.log('no more subscribers');
});

count.set(1); // does nothing

const unsubscribe = count.subscribe((value) => {
	console.log(value);
}); // logs 'got a subscriber', then '1'

unsubscribe(); // logs 'no more subscribers'
Note that the value of a writable is lost when it is destroyed, for example when the page is refreshed. However, you can write your own logic to sync the value to for example the localStorage.

readable
Creates a store whose value cannot be set from ‘outside’, the first argument is the store’s initial value, and the second argument to readable is the same as the second argument to writable.


import { readable } from 'svelte/store';

const time = readable(new Date(), (set) => {
	set(new Date());

	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		set(new Date());
	}, 1000);

	return () => clearInterval(interval);
});

const ticktock = readable('tick', (set, update) => {
	const interval = setInterval(() => {
		update((sound) => (sound === 'tick' ? 'tock' : 'tick'));
	}, 1000);

	return () => clearInterval(interval);
});
derived
Derives a store from one or more other stores. The callback runs initially when the first subscriber subscribes and then whenever the store dependencies change.

In the simplest version, derived takes a single store, and the callback returns a derived value.


import { derived } from 'svelte/store';

const doubled = derived(a, ($a) => $a * 2);
The callback can set a value asynchronously by accepting a second argument, set, and an optional third argument, update, calling either or both of them when appropriate.

In this case, you can also pass a third argument to derived — the initial value of the derived store before set or update is first called. If no initial value is specified, the store’s initial value will be undefined.


import { derived } from 'svelte/store';

const delayed = derived(
	a,
	($a, set) => {
		setTimeout(() => set($a), 1000);
	},
	2000
);

const delayedIncrement = derived(a, ($a, set, update) => {
	set($a);
	setTimeout(() => update((x) => x + 1), 1000);
	// every time $a produces a value, this produces two
	// values, $a immediately and then $a + 1 a second later
});
If you return a function from the callback, it will be called when a) the callback runs again, or b) the last subscriber unsubscribes.


import { derived } from 'svelte/store';

const tick = derived(
	frequency,
	($frequency, set) => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			set(Date.now());
		}, 1000 / $frequency);

		return () => {
			clearInterval(interval);
		};
	},
	2000
);
In both cases, an array of arguments can be passed as the first argument instead of a single store.


import { derived } from 'svelte/store';

const summed = derived([a, b], ([$a, $b]) => $a + $b);

const delayed = derived([a, b], ([$a, $b], set) => {
	setTimeout(() => set($a + $b), 1000);
});
readonly
This simple helper function makes a store readonly. You can still subscribe to the changes from the original one using this new readable store.


import { readonly, writable } from 'svelte/store';

const writableStore = writable(1);
const readableStore = readonly(writableStore);

readableStore.subscribe(console.log);

writableStore.set(2); // console: 2
readableStore.set(2); // ERROR
get
Generally, you should read the value of a store by subscribing to it and using the value as it changes over time. Occasionally, you may need to retrieve the value of a store to which you’re not subscribed. get allows you to do so.

This works by creating a subscription, reading the value, then unsubscribing. It’s therefore not recommended in hot code paths.


import { get } from 'svelte/store';

const value = get(store);
Store contract

store = { subscribe: (subscription: (value: any) => void) => (() => void), set?: (value: any) => void }
You can create your own stores without relying on svelte/store, by implementing the store contract:

A store must contain a .subscribe method, which must accept as its argument a subscription function. This subscription function must be immediately and synchronously called with the store’s current value upon calling .subscribe. All of a store’s active subscription functions must later be synchronously called whenever the store’s value changes.
The .subscribe method must return an unsubscribe function. Calling an unsubscribe function must stop its subscription, and its corresponding subscription function must not be called again by the store.
A store may optionally contain a .set method, which must accept as its argument a new value for the store, and which synchronously calls all of the store’s active subscription functions. Such a store is called a writable store.
For interoperability with RxJS Observables, the .subscribe method is also allowed to return an object with an .unsubscribe method, rather than return the unsubscription function directly. Note however that unless .subscribe synchronously calls the subscription (which is not required by the Observable spec), Svelte will see the value of the store as undefined until it does.

Context
Using context with state
Type-safe context
Replacing global state
Context allows components to access values owned by parent components without passing them down as props (potentially through many layers of intermediate components, known as ‘prop-drilling’). The parent component sets context with setContext(key, value)...

Parent

<script lang="ts">
	import { setContext } from 'svelte';

	setContext('my-context', 'hello from Parent.svelte');
</script>
...and the child retrieves it with getContext:

Child

<script lang="ts">
	import { getContext } from 'svelte';

	const message = getContext('my-context');
</script>

<h1>{message}, inside Child.svelte</h1>
This is particularly useful when Parent.svelte is not directly aware of Child.svelte, but instead renders it as part of a children snippet (demo):


<Parent>
	<Child />
</Parent>
The key ('my-context', in the example above) and the context itself can be any JavaScript value.

In addition to setContext and getContext, Svelte exposes hasContext and getAllContexts functions.

Using context with state
You can store reactive state in context (demo)...


<script>
	import { setContext } from 'svelte';
	import Child from './Child.svelte';

	let counter = $state({
		count: 0
	});

	setContext('counter', counter);
</script>

<button onclick={() => counter.count += 1}>
	increment
</button>

<Child />
<Child />
<Child />
...though note that if you reassign counter instead of updating it, you will ‘break the link’ — in other words instead of this...


<button onclick={() => counter = { count: 0 }}>
	reset
</button>
...you must do this:


<button onclick={() => counter.count = 0}>
	reset
</button>
Svelte will warn you if you get it wrong.

Type-safe context
As an alternative to using setContext and getContext directly, you can use them via createContext. This gives you type safety and makes it unnecessary to use a key:

context

import { createContext } from 'svelte';

export const [getUserContext, setUserContext] = createContext<User>();
Replacing global state
When you have state shared by many different components, you might be tempted to put it in its own module and just import it wherever it’s needed:

state.svelte

export const myGlobalState = $state({
	user: {
		// ...
	}
	// ...
});
In many cases this is perfectly fine, but there is a risk: if you mutate the state during server-side rendering (which is discouraged, but entirely possible!)...

App

<script lang="ts">
	import { myGlobalState } from './state.svelte.js';

	let { data } = $props();

	if (data.user) {
		myGlobalState.user = data.user;
	}
</script>
...then the data may be accessible by the next user. Context solves this problem because it is not shared between requests.

Lifecycle hooks
onMount
onDestroy
tick
Deprecated: beforeUpdate / afterUpdate
In Svelte 5, the component lifecycle consists of only two parts: Its creation and its destruction. Everything in-between — when certain state is updated — is not related to the component as a whole; only the parts that need to react to the state change are notified. This is because under the hood the smallest unit of change is actually not a component, it’s the (render) effects that the component sets up upon component initialization. Consequently, there’s no such thing as a “before update”/"after update” hook.

onMount
The onMount function schedules a callback to run as soon as the component has been mounted to the DOM. It must be called during the component’s initialisation (but doesn’t need to live inside the component; it can be called from an external module).

onMount does not run inside a component that is rendered on the server.


<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	onMount(() => {
		console.log('the component has mounted');
	});
</script>
If a function is returned from onMount, it will be called when the component is unmounted.


<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	onMount(() => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			console.log('beep');
		}, 1000);

		return () => clearInterval(interval);
	});
</script>
This behaviour will only work when the function passed to onMount is synchronous. async functions always return a Promise.

onDestroy
Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted.

Out of onMount, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate and onDestroy, this is the only one that runs inside a server-side component.


<script>
	import { onDestroy } from 'svelte';

	onDestroy(() => {
		console.log('the component is being destroyed');
	});
</script>
tick
While there’s no “after update” hook, you can use tick to ensure that the UI is updated before continuing. tick returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied, or in the next microtask if there are none.


<script>
	import { tick } from 'svelte';

	$effect.pre(() => {
		console.log('the component is about to update');
		tick().then(() => {
				console.log('the component just updated');
		});
	});
</script>
Deprecated: beforeUpdate / afterUpdate
Svelte 4 contained hooks that ran before and after the component as a whole was updated. For backwards compatibility, these hooks were shimmed in Svelte 5 but not available inside components that use runes.


<script>
	import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate } from 'svelte';

	beforeUpdate(() => {
		console.log('the component is about to update');
	});

	afterUpdate(() => {
		console.log('the component just updated');
	});
</script>
Instead of beforeUpdate use $effect.pre and instead of afterUpdate use $effect instead - these runes offer more granular control and only react to the changes you’re actually interested in.

Chat window example
To implement a chat window that autoscrolls to the bottom when new messages appear (but only if you were already scrolled to the bottom), we need to measure the DOM before we update it.

In Svelte 4, we do this with beforeUpdate, but this is a flawed approach — it fires before every update, whether it’s relevant or not. In the example below, we need to introduce checks like updatingMessages to make sure we don’t mess with the scroll position when someone toggles dark mode.

With runes, we can use $effect.pre, which behaves the same as $effect but runs before the DOM is updated. As long as we explicitly reference messages inside the effect body, it will run whenever messages changes, but not when theme changes.

beforeUpdate, and its equally troublesome counterpart afterUpdate, are therefore deprecated in Svelte 5.

Before
After

<script>
	import { beforeUpdate, afterUpdate, tick } from 'svelte';

	let updatingMessages = false;
	let theme = $state('dark');
	let messages = $state([]);

	let viewport;

	beforeUpdate(() => {
	$effect.pre(() => {
		if (!updatingMessages) return;
		messages;
		const autoscroll = viewport && viewport.offsetHeight + viewport.scrollTop > viewport.scrollHeight - 50;

		if (autoscroll) {
			tick().then(() => {
				viewport.scrollTo(0, viewport.scrollHeight);
			});
		}

		updatingMessages = false;
	});

	function handleKeydown(event) {
		if (event.key === 'Enter') {
			const text = event.target.value;
			if (!text) return;

			updatingMessages = true;
			messages = [...messages, text];
			event.target.value = '';
		}
	}

	function toggle() {
		theme = theme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';
	}
</script>

<div class:dark={theme === 'dark'}>
	<div bind:this={viewport}>
		{#each messages as message}
			<p>{message}</p>
		{/each}
	</div>

	<input onkeydown={handleKeydown} />

mount
unmount
render
hydrate
Every Svelte application starts by imperatively creating a root component. On the client this component is mounted to a specific element. On the server, you want to get back a string of HTML instead which you can render. The following functions help you achieve those tasks.

mount
Instantiates a component and mounts it to the given target:


import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = mount(App, {
	target: document.querySelector('#app'),
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
You can mount multiple components per page, and you can also mount from within your application, for example when creating a tooltip component and attaching it to the hovered element.

Note that unlike calling new App(...) in Svelte 4, things like effects (including onMount callbacks, and action functions) will not run during mount. If you need to force pending effects to run (in the context of a test, for example) you can do so with flushSync().

unmount
Unmounts a component that was previously created with mount or hydrate.

If options.outro is true, transitions will play before the component is removed from the DOM:


import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = mount(App, { target: document.body });

// later
unmount(app, { outro: true });
Returns a Promise that resolves after transitions have completed if options.outro is true, or immediately otherwise.

render
Only available on the server and when compiling with the server option. Takes a component and returns an object with body and head properties on it, which you can use to populate the HTML when server-rendering your app:


import { render } from 'svelte/server';
import App from './App.svelte';

const result = render(App, {
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
result.body; // HTML for somewhere in this <body> tag
result.head; // HTML for somewhere in this <head> tag
hydrate
Like mount, but will reuse up any HTML rendered by Svelte’s SSR output (from the render function) inside the target and make it interactive:


import { hydrate } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = hydrate(App, {
	target: document.querySelector('#app'),
	props: { some: 'property' }
});
As with mount, effects will not run during hydrate — use flushSync() immediately afterwards if you need them to.

Testing
Unit and component tests with Vitest
Component tests with Storybook
End-to-end tests with Playwright
Testing helps you write and maintain your code and guard against regressions. Testing frameworks help you with that, allowing you to describe assertions or expectations about how your code should behave. Svelte is unopinionated about which testing framework you use — you can write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using solutions like Vitest, Jasmine, Cypress and Playwright.

Unit and component tests with Vitest
Unit tests allow you to test small isolated parts of your code. Integration tests allow you to test parts of your application to see if they work together. If you’re using Vite (including via SvelteKit), we recommend using Vitest. You can use the Svelte CLI to setup Vitest either during project creation or later on.

To setup Vitest manually, first install it:


npm install -D vitest
Then adjust your vite.config.js:

vite.config

import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
	// ...
	// Tell Vitest to use the `browser` entry points in `package.json` files, even though it's running in Node
	resolve: process.env.VITEST
		? {
				conditions: ['browser']
			}
		: undefined
});
If loading the browser version of all your packages is undesirable, because (for example) you also test backend libraries, you may need to resort to an alias configuration

You can now write unit tests for code inside your .js/.ts files:

multiplier.svelte.test

import { flushSync } from 'svelte';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { multiplier } from './multiplier.svelte.js';

test('Multiplier', () => {
	let double = multiplier(0, 2);

	expect(double.value).toEqual(0);

	double.set(5);

	expect(double.value).toEqual(10);
});
multiplier.svelte

export function multiplier(initial: number, k: number) {
	let count = $state(initial);

	return {
		get value() {
			return count * k;
		},

		set: (c: number) => {
			count = c;
		}
	};
}
Using runes inside your test files
Since Vitest processes your test files the same way as your source files, you can use runes inside your tests as long as the filename includes .svelte:

multiplier.svelte.test

import { flushSync } from 'svelte';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { multiplier } from './multiplier.svelte.js';

test('Multiplier', () => {
	let count = $state(0);
	let double = multiplier(() => count, 2);

	expect(double.value).toEqual(0);

	count = 5;

	expect(double.value).toEqual(10);
});
multiplier.svelte

export function multiplier(getCount: () => number, k: number) {
	return {
		get value() {
			return getCount() * k;
		}
	};
}
If the code being tested uses effects, you need to wrap the test inside $effect.root:

logger.svelte.test

import { flushSync } from 'svelte';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { logger } from './logger.svelte.js';

test('Effect', () => {
	const cleanup = $effect.root(() => {
		let count = $state(0);

		// logger uses an $effect to log updates of its input
		let log = logger(() => count);

		// effects normally run after a microtask,
		// use flushSync to execute all pending effects synchronously
		flushSync();
		expect(log).toEqual([0]);

		count = 1;
		flushSync();

		expect(log).toEqual([0, 1]);
	});

	cleanup();
});
logger.svelte

export function logger(getValue: () => any) {
	let log: any[] = [];

	$effect(() => {
		log.push(getValue());
	});

	return log;
}

It is possible to test your components in isolation, which allows you to render them in a browser (real or simulated), simulate behavior, and make assertions, without spinning up your whole app.

Before writing component tests, think about whether you actually need to test the component, or if it’s more about the logic inside the component. If so, consider extracting out that logic to test it in isolation, without the overhead of a component.

To get started, install jsdom (a library that shims DOM APIs):


npm install -D jsdom
Then adjust your vite.config.js:

vite.config

import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		/* ... */
	],
	test: {
		// If you are testing components client-side, you need to setup a DOM environment.
		// If not all your files should have this environment, you can use a
		// `// @vitest-environment jsdom` comment at the top of the test files instead.
		environment: 'jsdom'
	},
	// Tell Vitest to use the `browser` entry points in `package.json` files, even though it's running in Node
	resolve: process.env.VITEST
		? {
				conditions: ['browser']
			}
		: undefined
});
After that, you can create a test file in which you import the component to test, interact with it programmatically and write expectations about the results:

component.test

import { flushSync, mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import Component from './Component.svelte';

test('Component', () => {
	// Instantiate the component using Svelte's `mount` API
	const component = mount(Component, {
		target: document.body, // `document` exists because of jsdom
		props: { initial: 0 }
	});

	expect(document.body.innerHTML).toBe('<button>0</button>');

	// Click the button, then flush the changes so you can synchronously write expectations
	document.body.querySelector('button').click();
	flushSync();

	expect(document.body.innerHTML).toBe('<button>1</button>');

	// Remove the component from the DOM
	unmount(component);
});
While the process is very straightforward, it is also low level and somewhat brittle, as the precise structure of your component may change frequently. Tools like @testing-library/svelte can help streamline your tests. The above test could be rewritten like this:

component.test

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/svelte';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';
import Component from './Component.svelte';

test('Component', async () => {
	const user = userEvent.setup();
	render(Component);

	const button = screen.getByRole('button');
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent(0);

	await user.click(button);
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent(1);
});
When writing component tests that involve two-way bindings, context or snippet props, it’s best to create a wrapper component for your specific test and interact with that. @testing-library/svelte contains some examples.

Component tests with Storybook
Storybook is a tool for developing and documenting UI components, and it can also be used to test your components. They’re run with Vitest’s browser mode, which renders your components in a real browser for the most realistic testing environment.

To get started, first install Storybook (using Svelte’s CLI) in your project via npx sv add storybook and choose the recommended configuration that includes testing features. If you’re already using Storybook, and for more information on Storybook’s testing capabilities, follow the Storybook testing docs to get started.

You can create stories for component variations and test interactions with the play function, which allows you to simulate behavior and make assertions using the Testing Library and Vitest APIs. Here’s an example of two stories that can be tested, one that renders an empty LoginForm component and one that simulates a user filling out the form:

LoginForm.stories

<script module>
	import { defineMeta } from '@storybook/addon-svelte-csf';
	import { expect, fn } from 'storybook/test';

	import LoginForm from './LoginForm.svelte';

	const { Story } = defineMeta({
		component: LoginForm,
		args: {
			// Pass a mock function to the `onSubmit` prop
			onSubmit: fn(),
		}
	});
</script>
 
<Story name="Empty Form" />
 
<Story
	name="Filled Form"
	play={async ({ args, canvas, userEvent }) => {
		// Simulate a user filling out the form
		await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('email'), 'email@provider.com');
		await userEvent.type(canvas.getByTestId('password'), 'a-random-password');
		await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));

		// Run assertions
		await expect(args.onSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
		await expect(canvas.getByText('You’re in!')).toBeInTheDocument();
	}}
/>
End-to-end tests with Playwright
E2E (short for ‘end to end’) tests allow you to test your full application through the eyes of the user. This section uses Playwright as an example, but you can also use other solutions like Cypress or NightwatchJS.

You can use the Svelte CLI to setup Playwright either during project creation or later on. You can also set it up with npm init playwright. Additionally, you may also want to install an IDE plugin such as the VS Code extension to be able to execute tests from inside your IDE.

If you’ve run npm init playwright or are not using Vite, you may need to adjust the Playwright config to tell Playwright what to do before running the tests - mainly starting your application at a certain port. For example:

playwright.config

const config = {
	webServer: {
		command: 'npm run build && npm run preview',
		port: 4173
	},
	testDir: 'tests',
	testMatch: /(.+\.)?(test|spec)\.[jt]s/
};

export default config;
You can now start writing tests. These are totally unaware of Svelte as a framework, so you mainly interact with the DOM and write assertions.

tests/hello-world.spec

import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test';

test('home page has expected h1', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('/');
	await expect(page.locator('h1')).toBeVisible();
});

The Component type
Enhancing built-in DOM types
You can use TypeScript within Svelte components. IDE extensions like the Svelte VS Code extension will help you catch errors right in your editor, and svelte-check does the same on the command line, which you can integrate into your CI.

<script lang="ts">
To use TypeScript inside your Svelte components, add lang="ts" to your script tags:


<script lang="ts">
	let name: string = 'world';

	function greet(name: string) {
		alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
	}
</script>

<button onclick={(e: Event) => greet(e.target.innerText)}>
	{name as string}
</button>
Doing so allows you to use TypeScript’s type-only features. That is, all features that just disappear when transpiling to JavaScript, such as type annotations or interface declarations. Features that require the TypeScript compiler to output actual code are not supported. This includes:

using enums
using private, protected or public modifiers in constructor functions together with initializers
using features that are not yet part of the ECMAScript standard (i.e. not level 4 in the TC39 process) and therefore not implemented yet within Acorn, the parser we use for parsing JavaScript
If you want to use one of these features, you need to setup up a script preprocessor.

Preprocessor setup
To use non-type-only TypeScript features within Svelte components, you need to add a preprocessor that will turn TypeScript into JavaScript.

svelte.config

import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

const config = {
	// Note the additional `{ script: true }`
	preprocess: vitePreprocess({ script: true })
};

export default config;
Using SvelteKit or Vite
The easiest way to get started is scaffolding a new SvelteKit project by typing npx sv create, following the prompts and choosing the TypeScript option.

svelte.config

import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

const config = {
	preprocess: vitePreprocess()
};

export default config;
If you don’t need or want all the features SvelteKit has to offer, you can scaffold a Svelte-flavoured Vite project instead by typing npm create vite@latest and selecting the svelte-ts option.

In both cases, a svelte.config.js with vitePreprocess will be added. Vite/SvelteKit will read from this config file.

Other build tools
If you’re using tools like Rollup or Webpack instead, install their respective Svelte plugins. For Rollup that’s rollup-plugin-svelte and for Webpack that’s svelte-loader. For both, you need to install typescript and svelte-preprocess and add the preprocessor to the plugin config (see the respective READMEs for more info). If you’re starting a new project, you can also use the rollup or webpack template to scaffold the setup from a script.

If you’re starting a new project, we recommend using SvelteKit or Vite instead

tsconfig.json settings
When using TypeScript, make sure your tsconfig.json is setup correctly.

Use a target of at least ES2015 so classes are not compiled to functions
Set verbatimModuleSyntax to true so that imports are left as-is
Set isolatedModules to true so that each file is looked at in isolation. TypeScript has a few features which require cross-file analysis and compilation, which the Svelte compiler and tooling like Vite don’t do.
Typing $props
Type $props just like a regular object with certain properties.


<script lang="ts">
	import type { Snippet } from 'svelte';

	interface Props {
		requiredProperty: number;
		optionalProperty?: boolean;
		snippetWithStringArgument: Snippet<[string]>;
		eventHandler: (arg: string) => void;
		[key: string]: unknown;
	}

	let {
		requiredProperty,
		optionalProperty,
		snippetWithStringArgument,
		eventHandler,
		...everythingElse
	}: Props = $props();
</script>

<button onclick={() => eventHandler('clicked button')}>
	{@render snippetWithStringArgument('hello')}
</button>
Generic $props
Components can declare a generic relationship between their properties. One example is a generic list component that receives a list of items and a callback property that receives an item from the list. To declare that the items property and the select callback operate on the same types, add the generics attribute to the script tag:


<script lang="ts" generics="Item extends { text: string }">
	interface Props {
		items: Item[];
		select(item: Item): void;
	}

	let { items, select }: Props = $props();
</script>

{#each items as item}
	<button onclick={() => select(item)}>
		{item.text}
	</button>
{/each}
The content of generics is what you would put between the <...> tags of a generic function. In other words, you can use multiple generics, extends and fallback types.

Typing wrapper components
In case you’re writing a component that wraps a native element, you may want to expose all the attributes of the underlying element to the user. In that case, use (or extend from) one of the interfaces provided by svelte/elements. Here’s an example for a Button component:


<script lang="ts">
	import type { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements';

	let { children, ...rest }: HTMLButtonAttributes = $props();
</script>

<button {...rest}>
	{@render children?.()}
</button>
Not all elements have a dedicated type definition. For those without one, use SvelteHTMLElements:


<script lang="ts">
	import type { SvelteHTMLElements } from 'svelte/elements';

	let { children, ...rest }: SvelteHTMLElements['div'] = $props();
</script>

<div {...rest}>
	{@render children?.()}
</div>
Typing $state
You can type $state like any other variable.


let count: number = $state(0);
If you don’t give $state an initial value, part of its types will be undefined.


// Error: Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'
let count: number = $state();
If you know that the variable will be defined before you first use it, use an as casting. This is especially useful in the context of classes:


class Counter {
	count = $state() as number;
	constructor(initial: number) {
		this.count = initial;
	}
}
The Component type
Svelte components are of type Component. You can use it and its related types to express a variety of constraints.

Using it together with dynamic components to restrict what kinds of component can be passed to it:


<script lang="ts">
	import type { Component } from 'svelte';

	interface Props {
		// only components that have at most the "prop"
		// property required can be passed
		DynamicComponent: Component<{ prop: string }>;
	}

	let { DynamicComponent }: Props = $props();
</script>

<DynamicComponent prop="foo" />
In Svelte 4, components were of type SvelteComponent

To extract the properties from a component, use ComponentProps.


import type { Component, ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';

function withProps<TComponent extends Component<any>>(
	component: TComponent,
	props: ComponentProps<TComponent>
) {}

// Errors if the second argument is not the correct props expected
// by the component in the first argument.
withProps(MyComponent, { foo: 'bar' });
To declare that a variable expects the constructor or instance type of a component:


<script lang="ts">
	import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';

	let componentConstructor: typeof MyComponent = MyComponent;
	let componentInstance: MyComponent;
</script>

<MyComponent bind:this={componentInstance} />
Enhancing built-in DOM types
Svelte provides a best effort of all the HTML DOM types that exist. Sometimes you may want to use experimental attributes or custom events coming from an action. In these cases, TypeScript will throw a type error, saying that it does not know these types. If it’s a non-experimental standard attribute/event, this may very well be a missing typing from our HTML typings. In that case, you are welcome to open an issue and/or a PR fixing it.

In case this is a custom or experimental attribute/event, you can enhance the typings by augmenting the svelte/elements module like this:

additional-svelte-typings.d

import { HTMLButtonAttributes } from 'svelte/elements';

declare module 'svelte/elements' {
	// add a new element
	export interface SvelteHTMLElements {
		'custom-button': HTMLButtonAttributes;
	}

	// add a new global attribute that is available on all html elements
	export interface HTMLAttributes<T> {
		globalattribute?: string;
	}

	// add a new attribute for button elements
	export interface HTMLButtonAttributes {
		veryexperimentalattribute?: string;
	}
}

export {}; // ensure this is not an ambient module, else types will be overridden instead of augmented
Then make sure that the d.ts file is referenced in your tsconfig.json. If it reads something like "include": ["src/**/*"] and your d.ts file is inside src, it should work. You may need to reload for the changes to take effect.

Custom elements
Component lifecycle
Component options
Caveats and limitations
Svelte components can also be compiled to custom elements (aka web components) using the customElement: true compiler option. You should specify a tag name for the component using the <svelte:options> element. Within the custom element you can access the host element via the $host rune.


<svelte:options customElement="my-element" />

<script>
	let { name = 'world' } = $props();
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
<slot />
You can leave out the tag name for any of your inner components which you don’t want to expose and use them like regular Svelte components. Consumers of the component can still name it afterwards if needed, using the static element property which contains the custom element constructor and which is available when the customElement compiler option is true.


import MyElement from './MyElement.svelte';

customElements.define('my-element', MyElement.element);
Once a custom element has been defined, it can be used as a regular DOM element:


document.body.innerHTML = `
	<my-element>
		<p>This is some slotted content</p>
	</my-element>
`;
Any props are exposed as properties of the DOM element (as well as being readable/writable as attributes, where possible).


const el = document.querySelector('my-element');

// get the current value of the 'name' prop
console.log(el.name);

// set a new value, updating the shadow DOM
el.name = 'everybody';
Note that you need to list out all properties explicitly, i.e. doing let props = $props() without declaring props in the component options means that Svelte can’t know which props to expose as properties on the DOM element.

Component lifecycle
Custom elements are created from Svelte components using a wrapper approach. This means the inner Svelte component has no knowledge that it is a custom element. The custom element wrapper takes care of handling its lifecycle appropriately.

When a custom element is created, the Svelte component it wraps is not created right away. It is only created in the next tick after the connectedCallback is invoked. Properties assigned to the custom element before it is inserted into the DOM are temporarily saved and then set on component creation, so their values are not lost. The same does not work for invoking exported functions on the custom element though, they are only available after the element has mounted. If you need to invoke functions before component creation, you can work around it by using the extend option.

When a custom element written with Svelte is created or updated, the shadow DOM will reflect the value in the next tick, not immediately. This way updates can be batched, and DOM moves which temporarily (but synchronously) detach the element from the DOM don’t lead to unmounting the inner component.

The inner Svelte component is destroyed in the next tick after the disconnectedCallback is invoked.

Component options
When constructing a custom element, you can tailor several aspects by defining customElement as an object within <svelte:options> since Svelte 4. This object may contain the following properties:

tag: string: an optional tag property for the custom element’s name. If set, a custom element with this tag name will be defined with the document’s customElements registry upon importing this component.
shadow: an optional property that can be set to "none" to forgo shadow root creation. Note that styles are then no longer encapsulated, and you can’t use slots
props: an optional property to modify certain details and behaviors of your component’s properties. It offers the following settings:
attribute: string: To update a custom element’s prop, you have two alternatives: either set the property on the custom element’s reference as illustrated above or use an HTML attribute. For the latter, the default attribute name is the lowercase property name. Modify this by assigning attribute: "<desired name>".
reflect: boolean: By default, updated prop values do not reflect back to the DOM. To enable this behavior, set reflect: true.
type: 'String' | 'Boolean' | 'Number' | 'Array' | 'Object': While converting an attribute value to a prop value and reflecting it back, the prop value is assumed to be a String by default. This may not always be accurate. For instance, for a number type, define it using type: "Number" You don’t need to list all properties, those not listed will use the default settings.
extend: an optional property which expects a function as its argument. It is passed the custom element class generated by Svelte and expects you to return a custom element class. This comes in handy if you have very specific requirements to the life cycle of the custom element or want to enhance the class to for example use ElementInternals for better HTML form integration.

<svelte:options
	customElement={{
		tag: 'custom-element',
		shadow: 'none',
		props: {
			name: { reflect: true, type: 'Number', attribute: 'element-index' }
		},
		extend: (customElementConstructor) => {
			// Extend the class so we can let it participate in HTML forms
			return class extends customElementConstructor {
				static formAssociated = true;

				constructor() {
					super();
					this.attachedInternals = this.attachInternals();
				}

				// Add the function here, not below in the component so that
				// it's always available, not just when the inner Svelte component
				// is mounted
				randomIndex() {
					this.elementIndex = Math.random();
				}
			};
		}
	}}
/>

<script>
	let { elementIndex, attachedInternals } = $props();
	// ...
	function check() {
		attachedInternals.checkValidity();
	}
</script>

...
While Typescript is supported in the extend function, it is subject to limitations: you need to set lang="ts" on one of the scripts AND you can only use erasable syntax in it. They are not processed by script preprocessors.

Caveats and limitations
Custom elements can be a useful way to package components for consumption in a non-Svelte app, as they will work with vanilla HTML and JavaScript as well as most frameworks. There are, however, some important differences to be aware of:

Styles are encapsulated, rather than merely scoped (unless you set shadow: "none"). This means that any non-component styles (such as you might have in a global.css file) will not apply to the custom element, including styles with the :global(...) modifier
Instead of being extracted out as a separate .css file, styles are inlined into the component as a JavaScript string
Custom elements are not generally suitable for server-side rendering, as the shadow DOM is invisible until JavaScript loads
In Svelte, slotted content renders lazily. In the DOM, it renders eagerly. In other words, it will always be created even if the component’s <slot> element is inside an {#if ...} block. Similarly, including a <slot> in an {#each ...} block will not cause the slotted content to be rendered multiple times
The deprecated let: directive has no effect, because custom elements do not have a way to pass data to the parent component that fills the slot
Polyfills are required to support older browsers
You can use Svelte’s context feature between regular Svelte components within a custom element, but you can’t use them across custom elements. In other words, you can’t use setContext on a parent custom element and read that with getContext in a child custom element.
Don’t declare properties or attributes starting with on, as their usage will be interpreted as an event listener. In other words, Svelte treats <custom-element oneworld={true}></custom-element> as customElement.addEventListener('eworld', true) (and not as customElement.oneworld = true)

Svelte 4 migration guide
Minimum version requirements
Browser conditions for bundlers
Removal of CJS related output
Stricter types for Svelte functions
Custom Elements with Svelte
SvelteComponentTyped is deprecated
Transitions are local by default
Default slot bindings
Preprocessors
New eslint package
Other breaking changes
This migration guide provides an overview of how to migrate from Svelte version 3 to 4. See the linked PRs for more details about each change. Use the migration script to migrate some of these automatically: npx svelte-migrate@latest svelte-4

If you’re a library author, consider whether to only support Svelte 4 or if it’s possible to support Svelte 3 too. Since most of the breaking changes don’t affect many people, this may be easily possible. Also remember to update the version range in your peerDependencies.

Minimum version requirements
Upgrade to Node 16 or higher. Earlier versions are no longer supported. (#8566)
If you are using SvelteKit, upgrade to 1.20.4 or newer (sveltejs/kit#10172)
If you are using Vite without SvelteKit, upgrade to vite-plugin-svelte 2.4.1 or newer (#8516)
If you are using webpack, upgrade to webpack 5 or higher and svelte-loader 3.1.8 or higher. Earlier versions are no longer supported. (#8515, 198dbcf)
If you are using Rollup, upgrade to rollup-plugin-svelte 7.1.5 or higher (198dbcf)
If you are using TypeScript, upgrade to TypeScript 5 or higher. Lower versions might still work, but no guarantees are made about that. (#8488)
Browser conditions for bundlers
Bundlers must now specify the browser condition when building a frontend bundle for the browser. SvelteKit and Vite will handle this automatically for you. If you’re using any others, you may observe lifecycle callbacks such as onMount not get called and you’ll need to update the module resolution configuration.

For Rollup this is done within the @rollup/plugin-node-resolve plugin by setting browser: true in its options. See the rollup-plugin-svelte documentation for more details
For webpack this is done by adding "browser" to the conditionNames array. You may also have to update your alias config, if you have set it. See the svelte-loader documentation for more details
(#8516)

Removal of CJS related output
Svelte no longer supports the CommonJS (CJS) format for compiler output and has also removed the svelte/register hook and the CJS runtime version. If you need to stay on the CJS output format, consider using a bundler to convert Svelte’s ESM output to CJS in a post-build step. (#8613)

Stricter types for Svelte functions
There are now stricter types for createEventDispatcher, Action, ActionReturn, and onMount:

createEventDispatcher now supports specifying that a payload is optional, required, or non-existent, and the call sites are checked accordingly (#7224)

import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

const dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{
	optional: number | null;
	required: string;
	noArgument: null;
}>();

// Svelte version 3:
dispatch('optional');
dispatch('required'); // I can still omit the detail argument
dispatch('noArgument', 'surprise'); // I can still add a detail argument

// Svelte version 4 using TypeScript strict mode:
dispatch('optional');
dispatch('required'); // error, missing argument
dispatch('noArgument', 'surprise'); // error, cannot pass an argument
Action and ActionReturn have a default parameter type of undefined now, which means you need to type the generic if you want to specify that this action receives a parameter. The migration script will migrate this automatically (#7442)

const action: Action = (node, params) => { ... } // this is now an error if you use params in any way
const action: Action<HTMLElement, string> = (node, params) => { ... } // params is of type string
onMount now shows a type error if you return a function asynchronously from it, because this is likely a bug in your code where you expect the callback to be called on destroy, which it will only do for synchronously returned functions (#8136)

// Example where this change reveals an actual bug
onMount(
	// someCleanup() not called because function handed to onMount is async
	async () => {
		const something = await foo();
           	// someCleanup() is called because function handed to onMount is sync
	() => {
		foo().then(something => {...});
		// ...
		return () => someCleanup();
	}
);
Custom Elements with Svelte
The creation of custom elements with Svelte has been overhauled and significantly improved. The tag option is deprecated in favor of the new customElement option:


<svelte:options tag="my-component" />
<svelte:options customElement="my-component" />
This change was made to allow more configurability for advanced use cases. The migration script will adjust your code automatically. The update timing of properties has changed slightly as well. (#8457)

SvelteComponentTyped is deprecated
SvelteComponentTyped is deprecated, as SvelteComponent now has all its typing capabilities. Replace all instances of SvelteComponentTyped with SvelteComponent.


import { SvelteComponentTyped } from 'svelte';
import { SvelteComponent } from 'svelte';

export class Foo extends SvelteComponentTyped<{ aProp: string }> {}
export class Foo extends SvelteComponent<{ aProp: string }> {}
If you have used SvelteComponent as the component instance type previously, you may see a somewhat opaque type error now, which is solved by changing : typeof SvelteComponent to : typeof SvelteComponent<any>.


<script>
	import ComponentA from './ComponentA.svelte';
	import ComponentB from './ComponentB.svelte';
	import { SvelteComponent } from 'svelte';

	let component: typeof SvelteComponent<any>;

	function choseRandomly() {
		component = Math.random() > 0.5 ? ComponentA : ComponentB;
	}
</script>

<button on:click={choseRandomly}>random</button>
<svelte:element this={component} />
The migration script will do both automatically for you. (#8512)

Transitions are local by default
Transitions are now local by default to prevent confusion around page navigations. “local” means that a transition will not play if it’s within a nested control flow block (each/if/await/key) and not the direct parent block but a block above it is created/destroyed. In the following example, the slide intro animation will only play when success goes from false to true, but it will not play when show goes from false to true:


{#if show}
	...
	{#if success}
		<p in:slide>Success</p>
	{/each}
{/if}
To make transitions global, add the |global modifier - then they will play when any control flow block above is created/destroyed. The migration script will do this automatically for you. (#6686)

Default slot bindings
Default slot bindings are no longer exposed to named slots and vice versa:


<script>
	import Nested from './Nested.svelte';
</script>

<Nested let:count>
	<p>
		count in default slot - is available: {count}
	</p>
	<p slot="bar">
		count in bar slot - is not available: {count}
	</p>
</Nested>
This makes slot bindings more consistent as the behavior is undefined when for example the default slot is from a list and the named slot is not. (#6049)

Preprocessors
The order in which preprocessors are applied has changed. Now, preprocessors are executed in order, and within one group, the order is markup, script, style.


import { preprocess } from 'svelte/compiler';

Each preprocessor must also have a name. (#8618)

New eslint package
eslint-plugin-svelte3 is deprecated. It may still work with Svelte 4 but we make no guarantees about that. We recommend switching to our new package eslint-plugin-svelte. See this Github post for an instruction how to migrate. Alternatively, you can create a new project using npm create svelte@latest, select the eslint (and possibly TypeScript) option and then copy over the related files into your existing project.

Other breaking changes
the inert attribute is now applied to outroing elements to make them invisible to assistive technology and prevent interaction. (#8628)
the runtime now uses classList.toggle(name, boolean) which may not work in very old browsers. Consider using a polyfill if you need to support these browsers. (#8629)
the runtime now uses the CustomEvent constructor which may not work in very old browsers. Consider using a polyfill if you need to support these browsers. (#8775)
people implementing their own stores from scratch using the StartStopNotifier interface (which is passed to the create function of writable etc) from svelte/store now need to pass an update function in addition to the set function. This has no effect on people using stores or creating stores using the existing Svelte stores. (#6750)
derived will now throw an error on falsy values instead of stores passed to it. (#7947)
type definitions for svelte/internal were removed to further discourage usage of those internal methods which are not public API. Most of these will likely change for Svelte 5
Removal of DOM nodes is now batched which slightly changes its order, which might affect the order of events fired if you’re using a MutationObserver on these elements (#8763)
if you enhanced the global typings through the svelte.JSX namespace before, you need to migrate this to use the svelteHTML namespace. Similarly if you used the svelte.JSX namespace to use type definitions from it, you need to migrate those to use the types from svelte/elements instead.

Other breaking changes
Version 5 comes with an overhauled syntax and reactivity system. While it may look different at first, you’ll soon notice many similarities. This guide goes over the changes in detail and shows you how to upgrade. Along with it, we also provide information on why we did these changes.

You don’t have to migrate to the new syntax right away - Svelte 5 still supports the old Svelte 4 syntax, and you can mix and match components using the new syntax with components using the old and vice versa. We expect many people to be able to upgrade with only a few lines of code changed initially. There’s also a migration script that helps you with many of these steps automatically.

Reactivity syntax changes
At the heart of Svelte 5 is the new runes API. Runes are basically compiler instructions that inform Svelte about reactivity. Syntactically, runes are functions starting with a dollar-sign.

let → $state
In Svelte 4, a let declaration at the top level of a component was implicitly reactive. In Svelte 5, things are more explicit: a variable is reactive when created using the $state rune. Let’s migrate the counter to runes mode by wrapping the counter in $state:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
</script>
Nothing else changes. count is still the number itself, and you read and write directly to it, without a wrapper like .value or getCount().

$: → $derived/$effect
In Svelte 4, a $: statement at the top level of a component could be used to declare a derivation, i.e. state that is entirely defined through a computation of other state. In Svelte 5, this is achieved using the $derived rune:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	$: const double = $derived(count * 2);
</script>
As with $state, nothing else changes. double is still the number itself, and you read it directly, without a wrapper like .value or getDouble().

A $: statement could also be used to create side effects. In Svelte 5, this is achieved using the $effect rune:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);

	$:$effect(() => {
		if (count > 5) {
			alert('Count is too high!');
		}
	});
</script>
Note that when $effect runs is different than when $: runs.

export let → $props
In Svelte 4, properties of a component were declared using export let. Each property was one declaration. In Svelte 5, all properties are declared through the $props rune, through destructuring:


<script>
	export let optional = 'unset';
	export let required;
	let { optional = 'unset', required } = $props();
</script>
There are multiple cases where declaring properties becomes less straightforward than having a few export let declarations:

you want to rename the property, for example because the name is a reserved identifier (e.g. class)
you don’t know which other properties to expect in advance
you want to forward every property to another component
All these cases need special syntax in Svelte 4:

renaming: export { klass as class}
other properties: $$restProps
all properties $$props
In Svelte 5, the $props rune makes this straightforward without any additional Svelte-specific syntax:

renaming: use property renaming let { class: klass } = $props();
other properties: use spreading let { foo, bar, ...rest } = $props();
all properties: don’t destructure let props = $props();

<script>
	let klass = '';
	export { klass as class};
	let { class: klass, ...rest } = $props();
</script>
<button class={klass} {...$$restPropsrest}>click me</button>
Event changes
Event handlers have been given a facelift in Svelte 5. Whereas in Svelte 4 we use the on: directive to attach an event listener to an element, in Svelte 5 they are properties like any other (in other words - remove the colon):


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
Since they’re just properties, you can use the normal shorthand syntax...


<script>
	let count = $state(0);

	function onclick() {
		count++;
	}
</script>

<button {onclick}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
...though when using a named event handler function it’s usually better to use a more descriptive name.

Component events
In Svelte 4, components could emit events by creating a dispatcher with createEventDispatcher.

This function is deprecated in Svelte 5. Instead, components should accept callback props - which means you then pass functions as properties to these components:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Pump from './Pump.svelte';

	let size = $state(15);
	let burst = $state(false);

	function reset() {
		size = 15;
		burst = false;
	}
</script>

<Pump
	on:inflate={(power) => {
		size += power.detail;
		if (size > 75) burst = true;
	}}
	on:deflate={(power) => {
		if (size > 0) size -= power.detail;
	}}
/>

{#if burst}
	<button onclick={reset}>new balloon</button>
	<span class="boom">💥</span>
{:else}
	<span class="balloon" style="scale: {0.01 * size}">
		🎈
	</span>
{/if}
Pump

<script lang="ts">
	import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';
	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

	let { inflate, deflate } = $props();
	let power = $state(5);
</script>

<button onclick={() => dispatch('inflate', power)inflate(power)}>
	inflate
</button>
<button onclick={() => dispatch('deflate', power)deflate(power)}>
	deflate
</button>
<button onclick={() => power--}>-</button>
Pump power: {power}
<button onclick={() => power++}>+</button>
Bubbling events
Instead of doing <button on:click> to ‘forward’ the event from the element to the component, the component should accept an onclick callback prop:


<script>
	let { onclick } = $props();
</script>

<button on:click {onclick}>
	click me
</button>
Note that this also means you can ‘spread’ event handlers onto the element along with other props instead of tediously forwarding each event separately:


<script>
	let props = $props();
</script>

<button {...$$props} on:click on:keydown on:all_the_other_stuff {...props}>
	click me
</button>
Event modifiers
In Svelte 4, you can add event modifiers to handlers:


<button on:click|once|preventDefault={handler}>...</button>
Modifiers are specific to on: and so do not work with modern event handlers. Adding things like event.preventDefault() inside the handler itself is preferable, since all the logic lives in one place rather than being split between handler and modifiers.

Since event handlers are just functions, you can create your own wrappers as necessary:


<script>
	function once(fn) {
		return function (event) {
			if (fn) fn.call(this, event);
			fn = null;
		};
	}

	function preventDefault(fn) {
		return function (event) {
			event.preventDefault();
			fn.call(this, event);
		};
	}
</script>

<button onclick={once(preventDefault(handler))}>...</button>
There are three modifiers — capture, passive and nonpassive — that can’t be expressed as wrapper functions, since they need to be applied when the event handler is bound rather than when it runs.

For capture, we add the modifier to the event name:


<button onclickcapture={...}>...</button>
Changing the passive option of an event handler, meanwhile, is not something to be done lightly. If you have a use case for it — and you probably don’t! — then you will need to use an action to apply the event handler yourself.

Multiple event handlers
In Svelte 4, this is possible:


<button on:click={one} on:click={two}>...</button>
Duplicate attributes/properties on elements — which now includes event handlers — are not allowed. Instead, do this:


<button
	onclick={(e) => {
		one(e);
		two(e);
	}}
>
	...
</button>
When spreading props, local event handlers must go after the spread, or they risk being overwritten:


<button
	{...props}
	onclick={(e) => {
		doStuff(e);
		props.onclick?.(e);
	}}
>
	...
</button>
Snippets instead of slots
In Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using slots. Svelte 5 replaces them with snippets, which are more powerful and flexible, and so slots are deprecated in Svelte 5.

They continue to work, however, and you can pass snippets to a component that uses slots:

Child

<slot />
<hr />
<slot name="foo" message="hello" />
Parent

<script lang="ts">
	import Child from './Child.svelte';
</script>

<Child>
	default child content

	{#snippet foo({ message })}
		message from child: {message}
	{/snippet}
</Child>
(The reverse is not true — you cannot pass slotted content to a component that uses {@render ...} tags.)

When using custom elements, you should still use <slot /> like before. In a future version, when Svelte removes its internal version of slots, it will leave those slots as-is, i.e. output a regular DOM tag instead of transforming it.

Default content
In Svelte 4, the easiest way to pass a piece of UI to the child was using a <slot />. In Svelte 5, this is done using the children prop instead, which is then shown with {@render children()}:


<script>
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

<slot />
{@render children?.()}
Multiple content placeholders
If you wanted multiple UI placeholders, you had to use named slots. In Svelte 5, use props instead, name them however you like and {@render ...} them:


<script>
	let { header, main, footer } = $props();
</script>

<header>
	<slot name="header" />
	{@render header()}
</header>

<main>
	<slot name="main" />
	{@render main()}
</main>

<footer>
	<slot name="footer" />
	{@render footer()}
</footer>
Passing data back up
In Svelte 4, you would pass data to a <slot /> and then retrieve it with let: in the parent component. In Svelte 5, snippets take on that responsibility:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import List from './List.svelte';
</script>

<List items={['one', 'two', 'three']} let:item>
	{#snippet item(text)}
		<span>{text}</span>
	{/snippet}
	<span slot="empty">No items yet</span>
	{#snippet empty()}
		<span>No items yet</span>
	{/snippet}
</List>
List

<script lang="ts">
	let { items, item, empty } = $props();
</script>

{#if items.length}
	<ul>
		{#each items as entry}
			<li>
				<slot item={entry} />
				{@render item(entry)}
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
{:else}
	<slot name="empty" />
	{@render empty?.()}
{/if}
Migration script
By now you should have a pretty good understanding of the before/after and how the old syntax relates to the new syntax. It probably also became clear that a lot of these migrations are rather technical and repetitive - something you don’t want to do by hand.

We thought the same, which is why we provide a migration script to do most of the migration automatically. You can upgrade your project by using npx sv migrate svelte-5. This will do the following things:

bump core dependencies in your package.json
migrate to runes (let → $state etc)
migrate to event attributes for DOM elements (on:click → onclick)
migrate slot creations to render tags (<slot /> → {@render children()})
migrate slot usages to snippets (<div slot="x">...</div> → {#snippet x()}<div>...</div>{/snippet})
migrate obvious component creations (new Component(...) → mount(Component, ...))
You can also migrate a single component in VS Code through the Migrate Component to Svelte 5 Syntax command, or in our Playground through the Migrate button.

Not everything can be migrated automatically, and some migrations need manual cleanup afterwards. The following sections describe these in more detail.

run
You may see that the migration script converts some of your $: statements to a run function which is imported from svelte/legacy. This happens if the migration script couldn’t reliably migrate the statement to a $derived and concluded this is a side effect instead. In some cases this may be wrong and it’s best to change this to use a $derived instead. In other cases it may be right, but since $: statements also ran on the server but $effect does not, it isn’t safe to transform it as such. Instead, run is used as a stopgap solution. run mimics most of the characteristics of $:, in that it runs on the server once, and runs as $effect.pre on the client ($effect.pre runs before changes are applied to the DOM; most likely you want to use $effect instead).


<script>
	import { run } from 'svelte/legacy';
	run(() => {
	$effect(() => {
		// some side effect code
	})
</script>
Event modifiers
Event modifiers are not applicable to event attributes (e.g. you can’t do onclick|preventDefault={...}). Therefore, when migrating event directives to event attributes, we need a function-replacement for these modifiers. These are imported from svelte/legacy, and should be migrated away from in favor of e.g. just using event.preventDefault().


<script>
	import { preventDefault } from 'svelte/legacy';
</script>

<button
	onclick={preventDefault((event) => {
		event.preventDefault();
		// ...
	})}
>
	click me
</button>
Things that are not automigrated
The migration script does not convert createEventDispatcher. You need to adjust those parts manually. It doesn’t do it because it’s too risky because it could result in breakage for users of the component, which the migration script cannot find out.

The migration script does not convert beforeUpdate/afterUpdate. It doesn’t do it because it’s impossible to determine the actual intent of the code. As a rule of thumb you can often go with a combination of $effect.pre (runs at the same time as beforeUpdate did) and tick (imported from svelte, allows you to wait until changes are applied to the DOM and then do some work).

Components are no longer classes
In Svelte 3 and 4, components are classes. In Svelte 5 they are functions and should be instantiated differently. If you need to manually instantiate components, you should use mount or hydrate (imported from svelte) instead. If you see this error using SvelteKit, try updating to the latest version of SvelteKit first, which adds support for Svelte 5. If you’re using Svelte without SvelteKit, you’ll likely have a main.js file (or similar) which you need to adjust:


import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app") });
const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app") });

export default app;
mount and hydrate have the exact same API. The difference is that hydrate will pick up the Svelte’s server-rendered HTML inside its target and hydrate it. Both return an object with the exports of the component and potentially property accessors (if compiled with accessors: true). They do not come with the $on, $set and $destroy methods you may know from the class component API. These are its replacements:

For $on, instead of listening to events, pass them via the events property on the options argument.


import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app") });
app.$on('event', callback);
const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app"), events: { event: callback } });
Note that using events is discouraged — instead, use callbacks

For $set, use $state instead to create a reactive property object and manipulate it. If you’re doing this inside a .js or .ts file, adjust the ending to include .svelte, i.e. .svelte.js or .svelte.ts.


import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app"), props: { foo: 'bar' } });
app.$set({ foo: 'baz' });
const props = $state({ foo: 'bar' });
const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app"), props });
props.foo = 'baz';
For $destroy, use unmount instead.


import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app"), props: { foo: 'bar' } });
app.$destroy();
const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app") });
unmount(app);
As a stop-gap-solution, you can also use createClassComponent or asClassComponent (imported from svelte/legacy) instead to keep the same API known from Svelte 4 after instantiating.


import { createClassComponent } from 'svelte/legacy';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app") });
const app = createClassComponent({ component: App, target: document.getElementById("app") });

export default app;
If this component is not under your control, you can use the compatibility.componentApi compiler option for auto-applied backwards compatibility, which means code using new Component(...) keeps working without adjustments (note that this adds a bit of overhead to each component). This will also add $set and $on methods for all component instances you get through bind:this.


/// svelte.config.js
export default {
	compilerOptions: {
		compatibility: {
			componentApi: 4
		}
	}
};
Note that mount and hydrate are not synchronous, so things like onMount won’t have been called by the time the function returns and the pending block of promises will not have been rendered yet (because #await waits a microtask to wait for a potentially immediately-resolved promise). If you need that guarantee, call flushSync (import from 'svelte') after calling mount/hydrate.

Server API changes
Similarly, components no longer have a render method when compiled for server-side rendering. Instead, pass the function to render from svelte/server:


import { render } from 'svelte/server';
import App from './App.svelte';

const { html, head } = App.render({ props: { message: 'hello' }});
const { html, head } = render(App, { props: { message: 'hello' }});
In Svelte 4, rendering a component to a string also returned the CSS of all components. In Svelte 5, this is no longer the case by default because most of the time you’re using a tooling chain that takes care of it in other ways (like SvelteKit). If you need CSS to be returned from render, you can set the css compiler option to 'injected' and it will add <style> elements to the head.

Component typing changes
The change from classes towards functions is also reflected in the typings: SvelteComponent, the base class from Svelte 4, is deprecated in favour of the new Component type which defines the function shape of a Svelte component. To manually define a component shape in a d.ts file:


import type { Component } from 'svelte';
export declare const MyComponent: Component<{
	foo: string;
}>;
To declare that a component of a certain type is required:


import { ComponentA, ComponentB } from 'component-library';
import type { SvelteComponent } from 'svelte';
import type { Component } from 'svelte';

let C: typeof SvelteComponent<{ foo: string }> = $state(
let C: Component<{ foo: string }> = $state(
	Math.random() ? ComponentA : ComponentB
);
The two utility types ComponentEvents and ComponentType are also deprecated. ComponentEvents is obsolete because events are defined as callback props now, and ComponentType is obsolete because the new Component type is the component type already (i.e. ComponentType<SvelteComponent<{ prop: string }>> is equivalent to Component<{ prop: string }>).

bind:this changes
Because components are no longer classes, using bind:this no longer returns a class instance with $set, $on and $destroy methods on it. It only returns the instance exports (export function/const) and, if you’re using the accessors option, a getter/setter-pair for each property.

<svelte:component> is no longer necessary
In Svelte 4, components are static — if you render <Thing>, and the value of Thing changes, nothing happens. To make it dynamic you had to use <svelte:component>.

This is no longer true in Svelte 5:


<script>
	import A from './A.svelte';
	import B from './B.svelte';

	let Thing = $state();
</script>

<select bind:value={Thing}>
	<option value={A}>A</option>
	<option value={B}>B</option>
</select>

<!-- these are equivalent -->
<Thing />
<svelte:component this={Thing} />
While migrating, keep in mind that your component’s name should be capitalized (Thing) to distinguish it from elements, unless using dot notation.

Dot notation indicates a component
In Svelte 4, <foo.bar> would create an element with a tag name of "foo.bar". In Svelte 5, foo.bar is treated as a component instead. This is particularly useful inside each blocks:


{#each items as item}
	<item.component {...item.props} />
{/each}
Whitespace handling changed
Previously, Svelte employed a very complicated algorithm to determine if whitespace should be kept or not. Svelte 5 simplifies this which makes it easier to reason about as a developer. The rules are:

Whitespace between nodes is collapsed to one whitespace
Whitespace at the start and end of a tag is removed completely
Certain exceptions apply such as keeping whitespace inside pre tags
As before, you can disable whitespace trimming by setting the preserveWhitespace option in your compiler settings or on a per-component basis in <svelte:options>.

Modern browser required
Svelte 5 requires a modern browser (in other words, not Internet Explorer) for various reasons:

it uses Proxies
elements with clientWidth / clientHeight/offsetWidth/offsetHeight bindings use a ResizeObserver rather than a convoluted <iframe> hack
<input type="range" bind:value={...} /> only uses an input event listener, rather than also listening for change events as a fallback
The legacy compiler option, which generated bulkier but IE-friendly code, no longer exists.

Changes to compiler options
The false / true (already deprecated previously) and the "none" values were removed as valid values from the css option
The legacy option was repurposed
The hydratable option has been removed. Svelte components are always hydratable now
The enableSourcemap option has been removed. Source maps are always generated now, tooling can choose to ignore it
The tag option was removed. Use <svelte:options customElement="tag-name" /> inside the component instead
The loopGuardTimeout, format, sveltePath, errorMode and varsReport options were removed
The children prop is reserved
Content inside component tags becomes a snippet prop called children. You cannot have a separate prop by that name.

Breaking changes in runes mode
Some breaking changes only apply once your component is in runes mode.

Bindings to component exports are not allowed
Exports from runes mode components cannot be bound to directly. For example, having export const foo = ... in component A and then doing <A bind:foo /> causes an error. Use bind:this instead — <A bind:this={a} /> — and access the export as a.foo. This change makes things easier to reason about, as it enforces a clear separation between props and exports.

Bindings need to be explicitly defined using $bindable()
In Svelte 4 syntax, every property (declared via export let) is bindable, meaning you can bind: to it. In runes mode, properties are not bindable by default: you need to denote bindable props with the $bindable rune.

If a bindable property has a default value (e.g. let { foo = $bindable('bar') } = $props();), you need to pass a non-undefined value to that property if you’re binding to it. This prevents ambiguous behavior — the parent and child must have the same value — and results in better performance (in Svelte 4, the default value was reflected back to the parent, resulting in wasteful additional render cycles).

accessors option is ignored
Setting the accessors option to true makes properties of a component directly accessible on the component instance.


<svelte:options accessors={true} />

<script>
	// available via componentInstance.name
	export let name;
</script>
In runes mode, properties are never accessible on the component instance. You can use component exports instead if you need to expose them.


<script>
	let { name } = $props();
	// available via componentInstance.getName()
	export const getName = () => name;
</script>
Alternatively, if the place where they are instantiated is under your control, you can also make use of runes inside .js/.ts files by adjusting their ending to include .svelte, i.e. .svelte.js or .svelte.ts, and then use $state:


import { mount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte'

const app = new App({ target: document.getElementById("app"), props: { foo: 'bar' } });
app.foo = 'baz'
const props = $state({ foo: 'bar' });
const app = mount(App, { target: document.getElementById("app"), props });
props.foo = 'baz';
immutable option is ignored
Setting the immutable option has no effect in runes mode. This concept is replaced by how $state and its variations work.

Classes are no longer “auto-reactive”
In Svelte 4, doing the following triggered reactivity:


<script>
	let foo = new Foo();
</script>

<button on:click={() => (foo.value = 1)}>{foo.value}</button
>
This is because the Svelte compiler treated the assignment to foo.value as an instruction to update anything that referenced foo. In Svelte 5, reactivity is determined at runtime rather than compile time, so you should define value as a reactive $state field on the Foo class. Wrapping new Foo() with $state(...) will have no effect — only vanilla objects and arrays are made deeply reactive.

Touch and wheel events are passive
When using onwheel, onmousewheel, ontouchstart and ontouchmove event attributes, the handlers are passive to align with browser defaults. This greatly improves responsiveness by allowing the browser to scroll the document immediately, rather than waiting to see if the event handler calls event.preventDefault().

In the very rare cases that you need to prevent these event defaults, you should use on instead (for example inside an action).

Attribute/prop syntax is stricter
In Svelte 4, complex attribute values needn’t be quoted:


<Component prop=this{is}valid />
This is a footgun. In runes mode, if you want to concatenate stuff you must wrap the value in quotes:


<Component prop="this{is}valid" />
Note that Svelte 5 will also warn if you have a single expression wrapped in quotes, like answer="{42}" — in Svelte 6, that will cause the value to be converted to a string, rather than passed as a number.

HTML structure is stricter
In Svelte 4, you were allowed to write HTML code that would be repaired by the browser when server-side rendering it. For example you could write this...


<table>
	<tr>
		<td>hi</td>
	</tr>
</table>
... and the browser would auto-insert a <tbody> element:


<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>hi</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
Svelte 5 is more strict about the HTML structure and will throw a compiler error in cases where the browser would repair the DOM.

Other breaking changes
Stricter @const assignment validation
Assignments to destructured parts of a @const declaration are no longer allowed. It was an oversight that this was ever allowed.

:is(...), :has(...), and :where(...) are scoped
Previously, Svelte did not analyse selectors inside :is(...), :has(...), and :where(...), effectively treating them as global. Svelte 5 analyses them in the context of the current component. Some selectors may now therefore be treated as unused if they were relying on this treatment. To fix this, use :global(...) inside the :is(...)/:has(...)/:where(...) selectors.

When using Tailwind’s @apply directive, add a :global selector to preserve rules that use Tailwind-generated :is(...) selectors:


main :global {
	@apply bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900;
}
CSS hash position no longer deterministic
Previously Svelte would always insert the CSS hash last. This is no longer guaranteed in Svelte 5. This is only breaking if you have very weird css selectors.

Scoped CSS uses :where(...)
To avoid issues caused by unpredictable specificity changes, scoped CSS selectors now use :where(.svelte-xyz123) selector modifiers alongside .svelte-xyz123 (where xyz123 is, as previously, a hash of the <style> contents). You can read more detail here.

In the event that you need to support ancient browsers that don’t implement :where, you can manually alter the emitted CSS, at the cost of unpredictable specificity changes:


css = css.replace(/:where\((.+?)\)/, '$1');

Error/warning codes have been renamed
Error and warning codes have been renamed. Previously they used dashes to separate the words, they now use underscores (e.g. foo-bar becomes foo_bar). Additionally, a handful of codes have been reworded slightly.

Reduced number of namespaces
The number of valid namespaces you can pass to the compiler option namespace has been reduced to html (the default), mathml and svg.

The foreign namespace was only useful for Svelte Native, which we’re planning to support differently in a 5.x minor.

beforeUpdate/afterUpdate changes
beforeUpdate no longer runs twice on initial render if it modifies a variable referenced in the template.

afterUpdate callbacks in a parent component will now run after afterUpdate callbacks in any child components.

beforeUpdate/afterUpdate no longer run when the component contains a <slot> and its content is updated.

Both functions are disallowed in runes mode — use $effect.pre(...) and $effect(...) instead.

contenteditable behavior change
If you have a contenteditable node with a corresponding binding and a reactive value inside it (example: <div contenteditable=true bind:textContent>count is {count}</div>), then the value inside the contenteditable will not be updated by updates to count because the binding takes full control over the content immediately and it should only be updated through it.

oneventname attributes no longer accept string values
In Svelte 4, it was possible to specify event attributes on HTML elements as a string:


<button onclick="alert('hello')">...</button>
This is not recommended, and is no longer possible in Svelte 5, where properties like onclick replace on:click as the mechanism for adding event handlers.

null and undefined become the empty string
In Svelte 4, null and undefined were printed as the corresponding string. In 99 out of 100 cases you want this to become the empty string instead, which is also what most other frameworks out there do. Therefore, in Svelte 5, null and undefined become the empty string.

bind:files values can only be null, undefined or FileList
bind:files is now a two-way binding. As such, when setting a value, it needs to be either falsy (null or undefined) or of type FileList.

Bindings now react to form resets
Previously, bindings did not take into account reset event of forms, and therefore values could get out of sync with the DOM. Svelte 5 fixes this by placing a reset listener on the document and invoking bindings where necessary.

walk no longer exported
svelte/compiler reexported walk from estree-walker for convenience. This is no longer true in Svelte 5, import it directly from that package instead in case you need it.

Content inside svelte:options is forbidden
In Svelte 4 you could have content inside a <svelte:options /> tag. It was ignored, but you could write something in there. In Svelte 5, content inside that tag is a compiler error.

<slot> elements in declarative shadow roots are preserved
Svelte 4 replaced the <slot /> tag in all places with its own version of slots. Svelte 5 preserves them in the case they are a child of a <template shadowrootmode="..."> element.

<svelte:element> tag must be an expression
In Svelte 4, <svelte:element this="div"> is valid code. This makes little sense — you should just do <div>. In the vanishingly rare case that you do need to use a literal value for some reason, you can do this:


<svelte:element this={"div"}>
Note that whereas Svelte 4 would treat <svelte:element this="input"> (for example) identically to <input> for the purposes of determining which bind: directives could be applied, Svelte 5 does not.

mount plays transitions by default
The mount function used to render a component tree plays transitions by default unless the intro option is set to false. This is different from legacy class components which, when manually instantiated, didn’t play transitions by default.

<img src={...}> and {@html ...} hydration mismatches are not repaired
In Svelte 4, if the value of a src attribute or {@html ...} tag differ between server and client (a.k.a. a hydration mismatch), the mismatch is repaired. This is very costly: setting a src attribute (even if it evaluates to the same thing) causes images and iframes to be reloaded, and reinserting a large blob of HTML is slow.

Since these mismatches are extremely rare, Svelte 5 assumes that the values are unchanged, but in development will warn you if they are not. To force an update you can do something like this:


<script>
	let { markup, src } = $props();

	if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
		// stash the values...
		const initial = { markup, src };

		// unset them...
		markup = src = undefined;

		$effect(() => {
			// ...and reset after we've mounted
			markup = initial.markup;
			src = initial.src;
		});
	}
</script>

{@html markup}
<img {src} />
Hydration works differently
Svelte 5 makes use of comments during server-side rendering which are used for more robust and efficient hydration on the client. You therefore should not remove comments from your HTML output if you intend to hydrate it, and if you manually authored HTML to be hydrated by a Svelte component, you need to adjust that HTML to include said comments at the correct positions.

onevent attributes are delegated
Event attributes replace event directives: Instead of on:click={handler} you write onclick={handler}. For backwards compatibility the on:event syntax is still supported and behaves the same as in Svelte 4. Some of the onevent attributes however are delegated, which means you need to take care to not stop event propagation on those manually, as they then might never reach the listener for this event type at the root.

--style-props uses a different element
Svelte 5 uses an extra <svelte-css-wrapper> element instead of a <div> to wrap the component when using CSS custom properties.

I’m new to Svelte. Where should I start?
We think the best way to get started is playing through the interactive tutorial. Each step there is mainly focused on one specific aspect and is easy to follow. You’ll be editing and running real Svelte components right in your browser.

Five to ten minutes should be enough to get you up and running. An hour and a half should get you through the entire tutorial.

Where can I get support?
If your question is about certain syntax, the reference docs are a good place to start.

Stack Overflow is a popular forum to ask code-level questions or if you’re stuck with a specific error. Read through the existing questions tagged with Svelte or ask your own!

There are online forums and chats which are a great place for discussion about best practices, application architecture or just to get to know fellow Svelte users. Our Discord or the Reddit channel are examples of that. If you have an answerable code-level question, Stack Overflow is usually a better fit.

Are there any third-party resources?
Svelte Society maintains a list of books and videos.

How can I get VS Code to syntax-highlight my .svelte files?
There is an official VS Code extension for Svelte.

Is there a tool to automatically format my .svelte files?
You can use prettier with the prettier-plugin-svelte plugin.

How do I document my components?
In editors which use the Svelte Language Server you can document Components, functions and exports using specially formatted comments.


<script>
	/** What should we call the user? */
	export let name = 'world';
</script>

<!--
@component
Here's some documentation for this component.
It will show up on hover.

- You can use markdown here.
- You can also use code blocks here.
- Usage:
  ```svelte
  <main name="Arethra">
  ```
-->
<main>
	<h1>
		Hello, {name}
	</h1>
</main>
Note: The @component is necessary in the HTML comment which describes your component.

Does Svelte scale?
There will be a blog post about this eventually, but in the meantime, check out this issue.

Is there a UI component library?
There are several UI component libraries as well as standalone components listed on the packages page.

How do I test Svelte apps?
How your application is structured and where logic is defined will determine the best way to ensure it is properly tested. It is important to note that not all logic belongs within a component - this includes concerns such as data transformation, cross-component state management, and logging, among others. Remember that the Svelte library has its own test suite, so you do not need to write tests to validate implementation details provided by Svelte.

A Svelte application will typically have three different types of tests: Unit, Component, and End-to-End (E2E).

Unit Tests: Focus on testing business logic in isolation. Often this is validating individual functions and edge cases. By minimizing the surface area of these tests they can be kept lean and fast, and by extracting as much logic as possible from your Svelte components more of your application can be covered using them. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup Vitest for unit testing. There are a number of other test runners that could be used as well.

Component Tests: Validating that a Svelte component mounts and interacts as expected throughout its lifecycle requires a tool that provides a Document Object Model (DOM). Components can be compiled (since Svelte is a compiler and not a normal library) and mounted to allow asserting against element structure, listeners, state, and all the other capabilities provided by a Svelte component. Tools for component testing range from an in-memory implementation like jsdom paired with a test runner like Vitest to solutions that leverage an actual browser to provide a visual testing capability such as Playwright or Cypress.

End-to-End Tests: To ensure your users are able to interact with your application it is necessary to test it as a whole in a manner as close to production as possible. This is done by writing end-to-end (E2E) tests which load and interact with a deployed version of your application in order to simulate how the user will interact with your application. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup Playwright for end-to-end testing. There are many other E2E test libraries available for use as well.

Some resources for getting started with testing:

Svelte docs on testing
Setup Vitest using the Svelte CLI
Svelte Testing Library
Svelte Component Testing in Cypress
Example using uvu test runner with JSDOM
Test Svelte components using Vitest & Playwright
Component testing with WebdriverIO
Is there a router?
The official routing library is SvelteKit. SvelteKit provides a filesystem router, server-side rendering (SSR), and hot module reloading (HMR) in one easy-to-use package. It shares similarities with Next.js for React and Nuxt.js for Vue.

However, you can use any router library. A sampling of available routers are highlighted on the packages page.

How do I write a mobile app with Svelte?
While most mobile apps are written without using JavaScript, if you’d like to leverage your existing Svelte components and knowledge of Svelte when building mobile apps, you can turn a SvelteKit SPA into a mobile app with Tauri or Capacitor. Mobile features like the camera, geolocation, and push notifications are available via plugins for both platforms.

Some work has been completed towards custom renderer support in Svelte 5, but this feature is not yet available. The custom rendering API would support additional mobile frameworks like Lynx JS and Svelte Native. Svelte Native was an option available for Svelte 4, but Svelte 5 does not currently support it. Svelte Native lets you write NativeScript apps using Svelte components that contain NativeScript UI components rather than DOM elements, which may be familiar for users coming from React Native.

Can I tell Svelte not to remove my unused styles?
No. Svelte removes the styles from the component and warns you about them in order to prevent issues that would otherwise arise.

Svelte’s component style scoping works by generating a class unique to the given component, adding it to the relevant elements in the component that are under Svelte’s control, and then adding it to each of the selectors in that component’s styles. When the compiler can’t see what elements a style selector applies to, there would be two bad options for keeping it:

If it keeps the selector and adds the scoping class to it, the selector will likely not match the expected elements in the component, and they definitely won’t if they were created by a child component or {@html ...}.
If it keeps the selector without adding the scoping class to it, the given style will become a global style, affecting your entire page.
If you need to style something that Svelte can’t identify at compile time, you will need to explicitly opt into global styles by using :global(...). But also keep in mind that you can wrap :global(...) around only part of a selector. .foo :global(.bar) { ... } will style any .bar elements that appear within the component’s .foo elements. As long as there’s some parent element in the current component to start from, partially global selectors like this will almost always be able to get you what you want.

Is Svelte v2 still available?
New features aren’t being added to it, and bugs will probably only be fixed if they are extremely nasty or present some sort of security vulnerability.

The documentation is still available here.

How do I do hot module reloading?
We recommend using SvelteKit, which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of Vite and svelte-hmr. There are also community plugins for rollup and webpack.

SvelteComponent
This was the base class for Svelte components in Svelte 4. Svelte 5+ components are completely different under the hood. For typing, use Component instead. To instantiate components, use mount instead. See migration guide for more info.

class SvelteComponent<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>,
	Events extends Record<string, any> = any,
	Slots extends Record<string, any> = any
> {…}
static element?: typeof HTMLElement;
The custom element version of the component. Only present if compiled with the customElement compiler option

[prop: string]: any;
constructor(options: ComponentConstructorOptions<Properties<Props, Slots>>);
deprecated This constructor only exists when using the asClassComponent compatibility helper, which is a stop-gap solution. Migrate towards using mount instead. See migration guide for more info.
$destroy(): void;
deprecated This method only exists when using one of the legacy compatibility helpers, which is a stop-gap solution. See migration guide for more info.
$on<K extends Extract<keyof Events, string>>(
	type: K,
	callback: (e: Events[K]) => void
): () => void;
deprecated This method only exists when using one of the legacy compatibility helpers, which is a stop-gap solution. See migration guide for more info.
$set(props: Partial<Props>): void;
deprecated This method only exists when using one of the legacy compatibility helpers, which is a stop-gap solution. See migration guide for more info.
SvelteComponentTyped
Use Component instead. See migration guide for more information.

class SvelteComponentTyped<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>,
	Events extends Record<string, any> = any,
	Slots extends Record<string, any> = any
> extends SvelteComponent<Props, Events, Slots> {}
afterUpdate
Use $effect instead

Schedules a callback to run immediately after the component has been updated.

The first time the callback runs will be after the initial onMount.

In runes mode use $effect instead.

function afterUpdate(fn: () => void): void;
beforeUpdate
Use $effect.pre instead

Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is updated after any state change.

The first time the callback runs will be before the initial onMount.

In runes mode use $effect.pre instead.

function beforeUpdate(fn: () => void): void;
createContext
Available since 5.40.0

Returns a [get, set] pair of functions for working with context in a type-safe way.

get will throw an error if no parent component called set.

function createContext<T>(): [() => T, (context: T) => T];
createEventDispatcher
Use callback props and/or the $host() rune instead — see migration guide

Creates an event dispatcher that can be used to dispatch component events. Event dispatchers are functions that can take two arguments: name and detail.

Component events created with createEventDispatcher create a CustomEvent. These events do not bubble. The detail argument corresponds to the CustomEvent.detail property and can contain any type of data.

The event dispatcher can be typed to narrow the allowed event names and the type of the detail argument:


const dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{
 loaded: null; // does not take a detail argument
 change: string; // takes a detail argument of type string, which is required
 optional: number | null; // takes an optional detail argument of type number
}>();
function createEventDispatcher<
	EventMap extends Record<string, any> = any
>(): EventDispatcher<EventMap>;
createRawSnippet
Create a snippet programmatically

function createRawSnippet<Params extends unknown[]>(
	fn: (...params: Getters<Params>) => {
		render: () => string;
		setup?: (element: Element) => void | (() => void);
	}
): Snippet<Params>;
flushSync
Synchronously flush any pending updates. Returns void if no callback is provided, otherwise returns the result of calling the callback.

function flushSync<T = void>(fn?: (() => T) | undefined): T;
fork
Available since 5.42

Creates a ‘fork’, in which state changes are evaluated but not applied to the DOM. This is useful for speculatively loading data (for example) when you suspect that the user is about to take some action.

Frameworks like SvelteKit can use this to preload data when the user touches or hovers over a link, making any subsequent navigation feel instantaneous.

The fn parameter is a synchronous function that modifies some state. The state changes will be reverted after the fork is initialised, then reapplied if and when the fork is eventually committed.

When it becomes clear that a fork will not be committed (e.g. because the user navigated elsewhere), it must be discarded to avoid leaking memory.

function fork(fn: () => void): Fork;
getAbortSignal
Returns an AbortSignal that aborts when the current derived or effect re-runs or is destroyed.

Must be called while a derived or effect is running.


<script>
	import { getAbortSignal } from 'svelte';

	let { id } = $props();

	async function getData(id) {
		const response = await fetch(`/items/${id}`, {
			signal: getAbortSignal()
		});

		return await response.json();
	}

	const data = $derived(await getData(id));
</script>
function getAbortSignal(): AbortSignal;
getAllContexts
Retrieves the whole context map that belongs to the closest parent component. Must be called during component initialisation. Useful, for example, if you programmatically create a component and want to pass the existing context to it.

function getAllContexts<
	T extends Map<any, any> = Map<any, any>
>(): T;
getContext
Retrieves the context that belongs to the closest parent component with the specified key. Must be called during component initialisation.

createContext is a type-safe alternative.

function getContext<T>(key: any): T;
hasContext
Checks whether a given key has been set in the context of a parent component. Must be called during component initialisation.

function hasContext(key: any): boolean;
hydrate
Hydrates a component on the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with accessors: true) of the component

function hydrate<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>
>(
	component:
		| ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>>
		| Component<Props, Exports, any>,
	options: {} extends Props
		? {
				target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
				props?: Props;
				events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
				context?: Map<any, any>;
				intro?: boolean;
				recover?: boolean;
			}
		: {
				target: Document | Element | ShadowRoot;
				props: Props;
				events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
				context?: Map<any, any>;
				intro?: boolean;
				recover?: boolean;
			}
): Exports;
mount
Mounts a component to the given target and returns the exports and potentially the props (if compiled with accessors: true) of the component. Transitions will play during the initial render unless the intro option is set to false.

function mount<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>
>(
	component:
		| ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props>>
		| Component<Props, Exports, any>,
	options: MountOptions<Props>
): Exports;
onDestroy
Schedules a callback to run immediately before the component is unmounted.

Out of onMount, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate and onDestroy, this is the only one that runs inside a server-side component.

function onDestroy(fn: () => any): void;
onMount
onMount, like $effect, schedules a function to run as soon as the component has been mounted to the DOM. Unlike $effect, the provided function only runs once.

It must be called during the component’s initialisation (but doesn’t need to live inside the component; it can be called from an external module). If a function is returned synchronously from onMount, it will be called when the component is unmounted.

onMount functions do not run during server-side rendering.

function onMount<T>(
	fn: () =>
		| NotFunction<T>
		| Promise<NotFunction<T>>
		| (() => any)
): void;
setContext
Associates an arbitrary context object with the current component and the specified key and returns that object. The context is then available to children of the component (including slotted content) with getContext.

Like lifecycle functions, this must be called during component initialisation.

createContext is a type-safe alternative.

function setContext<T>(key: any, context: T): T;
settled
Available since 5.36

Returns a promise that resolves once any state changes, and asynchronous work resulting from them, have resolved and the DOM has been updated

function settled(): Promise<void>;
tick
Returns a promise that resolves once any pending state changes have been applied.

function tick(): Promise<void>;
unmount
Unmounts a component that was previously mounted using mount or hydrate.

Since 5.13.0, if options.outro is true, transitions will play before the component is removed from the DOM.

Returns a Promise that resolves after transitions have completed if options.outro is true, or immediately otherwise (prior to 5.13.0, returns void).


import { mount, unmount } from 'svelte';
import App from './App.svelte';

const app = mount(App, { target: document.body });

// later...
unmount(app, { outro: true });
function unmount(
	component: Record<string, any>,
	options?:
		| {
				outro?: boolean;
		  }
		| undefined
): Promise<void>;
untrack
When used inside a $derived or $effect, any state read inside fn will not be treated as a dependency.


$effect(() => {
	// this will run when `data` changes, but not when `time` changes
	save(data, {
		timestamp: untrack(() => time)
	});
});
function untrack<T>(fn: () => T): T;
Component
Can be used to create strongly typed Svelte components.

Example:
You have component library on npm called component-library, from which you export a component called MyComponent. For Svelte+TypeScript users, you want to provide typings. Therefore you create a index.d.ts:


import type { Component } from 'svelte';
export declare const MyComponent: Component<{ foo: string }> {}
Typing this makes it possible for IDEs like VS Code with the Svelte extension to provide intellisense and to use the component like this in a Svelte file with TypeScript:


<script lang="ts">
	import { MyComponent } from "component-library";
</script>
<MyComponent foo={'bar'} />
interface Component<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = {},
	Exports extends Record<string, any> = {},
	Bindings extends keyof Props | '' = string
> {…}
(
	this: void,
	internals: ComponentInternals,
	props: Props
): {
	/**
	 * @deprecated This method only exists when using one of the legacy compatibility helpers, which
	 * is a stop-gap solution. See [migration guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Components-are-no-longer-classes)
	 * for more info.
	 */
	$on?(type: string, callback: (e: any) => void): () => void;
	/**
	 * @deprecated This method only exists when using one of the legacy compatibility helpers, which
	 * is a stop-gap solution. See [migration guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide#Components-are-no-longer-classes)
	 * for more info.
	 */
	$set?(props: Partial<Props>): void;
} & Exports;
internal An internal object used by Svelte. Do not use or modify.
props The props passed to the component.
element?: typeof HTMLElement;
The custom element version of the component. Only present if compiled with the customElement compiler option

ComponentConstructorOptions
In Svelte 4, components are classes. In Svelte 5, they are functions. Use mount instead to instantiate components. See migration guide for more info.

interface ComponentConstructorOptions<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>
> {…}
target: Element | Document | ShadowRoot;
anchor?: Element;
props?: Props;
context?: Map<any, any>;
hydrate?: boolean;
intro?: boolean;
recover?: boolean;
sync?: boolean;
idPrefix?: string;
$$inline?: boolean;
ComponentEvents
The new Component type does not have a dedicated Events type. Use ComponentProps instead.

type ComponentEvents<Comp extends SvelteComponent> =
	Comp extends SvelteComponent<any, infer Events>
		? Events
		: never;
ComponentInternals
Internal implementation details that vary between environments

type ComponentInternals = Branded<{}, 'ComponentInternals'>;
ComponentProps
Convenience type to get the props the given component expects.

Example: Ensure a variable contains the props expected by MyComponent:


import type { ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';

// Errors if these aren't the correct props expected by MyComponent.
const props: ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent> = { foo: 'bar' };
In Svelte 4, you would do ComponentProps<MyComponent> because MyComponent was a class.

Example: A generic function that accepts some component and infers the type of its props:


import type { Component, ComponentProps } from 'svelte';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte';

function withProps<TComponent extends Component<any>>(
	component: TComponent,
	props: ComponentProps<TComponent>
) {};

// Errors if the second argument is not the correct props expected by the component in the first argument.
withProps(MyComponent, { foo: 'bar' });
type ComponentProps<
	Comp extends SvelteComponent | Component<any, any>
> =
	Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props>
		? Props
		: Comp extends Component<infer Props, any>
			? Props
			: never;
ComponentType
This type is obsolete when working with the new Component type.

type ComponentType<
	Comp extends SvelteComponent = SvelteComponent
> = (new (
	options: ComponentConstructorOptions<
		Comp extends SvelteComponent<infer Props>
			? Props
			: Record<string, any>
	>

Fork
Available since 5.42

Represents work that is happening off-screen, such as data being preloaded in anticipation of the user navigating

interface Fork {…}
commit(): Promise<void>;
Commit the fork. The promise will resolve once the state change has been applied

discard(): void;
Discard the fork

MountOptions
Defines the options accepted by the mount() function.

type MountOptions<
	Props extends Record<string, any> = Record<string, any>
> = {
	/**
	 * Target element where the component will be mounted.
	 */

	/**
	 * Optional node inside `target`. When specified, it is used to render the component immediately before it.
	 */
	anchor?: Node;
	/**
	 * Allows the specification of events.
	 * @deprecated Use callback props instead.
	 */
	events?: Record<string, (e: any) => any>;
	/**
	 * Can be accessed via `getContext()` at the component level.
	 */
	context?: Map<any, any>;
	/**
	 * Whether or not to play transitions on initial render.
	 * @default true
	 */
	intro?: boolean;
} & ({} extends Props
	? {
			/**
			 * Component properties.
			 */
			props?: Props;
		}
	: {
			/**
			 * Component properties.
			 */
			props: Props;
		});
Snippet
The type of a #snippet block. You can use it to (for example) express that your component expects a snippet of a certain type:


let { banner }: { banner: Snippet<[{ text: string }]> } = $props();
You can only call a snippet through the {@render ...} tag.

See the snippet documentation for more info.

interface Snippet<Parameters extends unknown[] = []> {…}
(
	this: void,
	// this conditional allows tuples but not arrays. Arrays would indicate a
	// rest parameter type, which is not supported. If rest parameters are added
	// in the future, the condition can be removed.
	...args: number extends Parameters['length'] ? never : Parameters
): {
	'{@render ...} must be called with a Snippet': "import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'";
} & typeof SnippetReturn;

Action
ActionReturn
This module provides types for actions, which have been superseded by attachments.

Action
Actions are functions that are called when an element is created. You can use this interface to type such actions. The following example defines an action that only works on <div> elements and optionally accepts a parameter which it has a default value for:


export const myAction: Action<HTMLDivElement, { someProperty: boolean } | undefined> = (node, param = { someProperty: true }) => {
	// ...
}
Action<HTMLDivElement> and Action<HTMLDivElement, undefined> both signal that the action accepts no parameters.

You can return an object with methods update and destroy from the function and type which additional attributes and events it has. See interface ActionReturn for more details.

interface Action<
	Element = HTMLElement,
	Parameter = undefined,
	Attributes extends Record<string, any> = Record<
		never,
		any
	>
> {…}
<Node extends Element>(
	...args: undefined extends Parameter
		? [node: Node, parameter?: Parameter]
		: [node: Node, parameter: Parameter]
): void | ActionReturn<Parameter, Attributes>;
ActionReturn
Actions can return an object containing the two properties defined in this interface. Both are optional.

update: An action can have a parameter. This method will be called whenever that parameter changes, immediately after Svelte has applied updates to the markup. ActionReturn and ActionReturn<undefined> both mean that the action accepts no parameters.
destroy: Method that is called after the element is unmounted
Additionally, you can specify which additional attributes and events the action enables on the applied element. This applies to TypeScript typings only and has no effect at runtime.

Example usage:


interface Attributes {
	newprop?: string;
	'on:event': (e: CustomEvent<boolean>) => void;
}

export function myAction(node: HTMLElement, parameter: Parameter): ActionReturn<Parameter, Attributes> {
	// ...
	return {
		update: (updatedParameter) => {...},
		destroy: () => {...}
	};
}
interface ActionReturn<
	Parameter = undefined,
	Attributes extends Record<string, any> = Record<
		never,
		any
	>
> {…}
update?: (parameter: Parameter) => void;
destroy?: () => void;

flip
The flip function calculates the start and end position of an element and animates between them, translating the x and y values. flip stands for First, Last, Invert, Play.

function flip(

Attachment

import { createAttachmentKey, fromAction } from 'svelte/attachments';
createAttachmentKey
Available since 5.29

Creates an object key that will be recognised as an attachment when the object is spread onto an element, as a programmatic alternative to using {@attach ...}. This can be useful for library authors, though is generally not needed when building an app.


<script>
	import { createAttachmentKey } from 'svelte/attachments';

	const props = {
		class: 'cool',
		onclick: () => alert('clicked'),
		[createAttachmentKey()]: (node) => {
			node.textContent = 'attached!';
		}
	};
</script>

<button {...props}>click me</button>
function createAttachmentKey(): symbol;
fromAction
Converts an action into an attachment keeping the same behavior. It’s useful if you want to start using attachments on components but you have actions provided by a library.

Note that the second argument, if provided, must be a function that returns the argument to the action function, not the argument itself.


<!-- with an action -->
<div use:foo={bar}>...</div>

<!-- with an attachment -->
<div {@attach fromAction(foo, () => bar)}>...</div>
function fromAction<
	E extends EventTarget,
	T extends unknown
>(
	action:
		| Action<E, T>
		| ((element: E, arg: T) => void | ActionReturn<T>),
	fn: () => T
): Attachment<E>;
function fromAction<E extends EventTarget>(
	action:
		| Action<E, void>
		| ((element: E) => void | ActionReturn<void>)
): Attachment<E>;
Attachment
An attachment is a function that runs when an element is mounted to the DOM, and optionally returns a function that is called when the element is later removed.

It can be attached to an element with an {@attach ...} tag, or by spreading an object containing a property created with createAttachmentKey.

interface Attachment<T extends EventTarget = Element> {…}
(element: T): void | (() => void);

import {
	VERSION,
	compile,
	compileModule,
	migrate,
	parse,
	preprocess,
	walk
} from 'svelte/compiler';
VERSION
The current version, as set in package.json.

const VERSION: string;
compile
compile converts your .svelte source code into a JavaScript module that exports a component

function compile(
	source: string,
	options: CompileOptions
): CompileResult;
compileModule
compileModule takes your JavaScript source code containing runes, and turns it into a JavaScript module.

function compileModule(
	source: string,
	options: ModuleCompileOptions
): CompileResult;
migrate
Does a best-effort migration of Svelte code towards using runes, event attributes and render tags. May throw an error if the code is too complex to migrate automatically.

function migrate(
	source: string,
	{
		filename,
		use_ts
	}?:
		| {
				filename?: string;
				use_ts?: boolean;
		  }
		| undefined
): {
	code: string;
};
parse
The parse function parses a component, returning only its abstract syntax tree.

The modern option (false by default in Svelte 5) makes the parser return a modern AST instead of the legacy AST. modern will become true by default in Svelte 6, and the option will be removed in Svelte 7.

function parse(
	source: string,
	options: {
		filename?: string;
		modern: true;
		loose?: boolean;
	}
): AST.Root;
function parse(
	source: string,
	options?:
		| {
				filename?: string;
				modern?: false;
				loose?: boolean;
		  }
		| undefined
): Record<string, any>;
preprocess
The preprocess function provides convenient hooks for arbitrarily transforming component source code. For example, it can be used to convert a <style lang="sass"> block into vanilla CSS.

function preprocess(
	source: string,
	preprocessor: PreprocessorGroup | PreprocessorGroup[],
	options?:
		| {
				filename?: string;
		  }
		| undefined
): Promise<Processed>;
walk

CompileError
interface CompileError extends ICompileDiagnostic {}
CompileOptions
interface CompileOptions extends ModuleCompileOptions {…}
name?: string;
Sets the name of the resulting JavaScript class (though the compiler will rename it if it would otherwise conflict with other variables in scope). If unspecified, will be inferred from filename

customElement?: boolean;
default false
If true, tells the compiler to generate a custom element constructor instead of a regular Svelte component.

accessors?: boolean;
default false
deprecated This will have no effect in runes mode
If true, getters and setters will be created for the component’s props. If false, they will only be created for readonly exported values (i.e. those declared with const, class and function). If compiling with customElement: true this option defaults to true.

namespace?: Namespace;
default 'html'
The namespace of the element; e.g., "html", "svg", "mathml".

immutable?: boolean;
default false
deprecated This will have no effect in runes mode
If true, tells the compiler that you promise not to mutate any objects. This allows it to be less conservative about checking whether values have changed.

css?: 'injected' | 'external';
'injected': styles will be included in the head when using render(...), and injected into the document (if not already present) when the component mounts. For components compiled as custom elements, styles are injected to the shadow root.
'external': the CSS will only be returned in the css field of the compilation result. Most Svelte bundler plugins will set this to 'external' and use the CSS that is statically generated for better performance, as it will result in smaller JavaScript bundles and the output can be served as cacheable .css files. This is always 'injected' when compiling with customElement mode.
cssHash?: CssHashGetter;
default undefined
A function that takes a { hash, css, name, filename } argument and returns the string that is used as a classname for scoped CSS. It defaults to returning svelte-${hash(filename ?? css)}.

preserveComments?: boolean;
default false
If true, your HTML comments will be preserved in the output. By default, they are stripped out.

preserveWhitespace?: boolean;
default false
If true, whitespace inside and between elements is kept as you typed it, rather than removed or collapsed to a single space where possible.

fragments?: 'html' | 'tree';
default 'html'
available since v5.33
Which strategy to use when cloning DOM fragments:

html populates a <template> with innerHTML and clones it. This is faster, but cannot be used if your app’s Content Security Policy includes require-trusted-types-for 'script'
tree creates the fragment one element at a time and then clones it. This is slower, but works everywhere
runes?: boolean | undefined;
default undefined
Set to true to force the compiler into runes mode, even if there are no indications of runes usage. Set to false to force the compiler into ignoring runes, even if there are indications of runes usage. Set to undefined (the default) to infer runes mode from the component code. Is always true for JS/TS modules compiled with Svelte. Will be true by default in Svelte 6. Note that setting this to true in your svelte.config.js will force runes mode for your entire project, including components in node_modules, which is likely not what you want. If you’re using Vite, consider using dynamicCompileOptions instead.

discloseVersion?: boolean;
default true
If true, exposes the Svelte major version in the browser by adding it to a Set stored in the global window.__svelte.v.

compatibility?: {…}
deprecated Use these only as a temporary solution before migrating your code
componentApi?: 4 | 5;
default 5
Applies a transformation so that the default export of Svelte files can still be instantiated the same way as in Svelte 4 — as a class when compiling for the browser (as though using createClassComponent(MyComponent, {...}) from svelte/legacy) or as an object with a .render(...) method when compiling for the server

sourcemap?: object | string;
default null
An initial sourcemap that will be merged into the final output sourcemap. This is usually the preprocessor sourcemap.

outputFilename?: string;
default null
Used for your JavaScript sourcemap.

cssOutputFilename?: string;
default null
Used for your CSS sourcemap.

hmr?: boolean;
default false
If true, compiles components with hot reloading support.

modernAst?: boolean;
default false
If true, returns the modern version of the AST. Will become true by default in Svelte 6, and the option will be removed in Svelte 7.

CompileResult
The return value of compile from svelte/compiler

interface CompileResult {…}
js: {…}
The compiled JavaScript

code: string;
The generated code

map: SourceMap;
A source map

css: null | {
	/** The generated code */
	code: string;
	/** A source map */
	map: SourceMap;
	/** Whether or not the CSS includes global rules */
	hasGlobal: boolean;
};
The compiled CSS

warnings: Warning[];
An array of warning objects that were generated during compilation. Each warning has several properties:

code is a string identifying the category of warning
message describes the issue in human-readable terms
start and end, if the warning relates to a specific location, are objects with line, column and character properties
metadata: {…}
Metadata about the compiled component

runes: boolean;
Whether the file was compiled in runes mode, either because of an explicit option or inferred from usage. For compileModule, this is always true

ast: any;
The AST

MarkupPreprocessor
A markup preprocessor that takes a string of code and returns a processed version.

type MarkupPreprocessor = (options: {
	/**
	 * The whole Svelte file content
	 */
	content: string;
	/**
	 * The filename of the Svelte file
	 */
	filename?: string;
}) => Processed | void | Promise<Processed | void>;
ModuleCompileOptions
interface ModuleCompileOptions {…}
dev?: boolean;
default false
If true, causes extra code to be added that will perform runtime checks and provide debugging information during development.

generate?: 'client' | 'server' | false;
default 'client'
If "client", Svelte emits code designed to run in the browser. If "server", Svelte emits code suitable for server-side rendering. If false, nothing is generated. Useful for tooling that is only interested in warnings.

filename?: string;
Used for debugging hints and sourcemaps. Your bundler plugin will set it automatically.

rootDir?: string;
default process.cwd() on node-like environments, undefined elsewhere
Used for ensuring filenames don’t leak filesystem information. Your bundler plugin will set it automatically.

warningFilter?: (warning: Warning) => boolean;
A function that gets a Warning as an argument and returns a boolean. Use this to filter out warnings. Return true to keep the warning, false to discard it.

experimental?: {…}
available since v5.36
Experimental options

async?: boolean;
available since v5.36
Allow await keyword in deriveds, template expressions, and the top level of components

Preprocessor
A script/style preprocessor that takes a string of code and returns a processed version.

type Preprocessor = (options: {
	/**
	 * The script/style tag content
	 */
	content: string;
	/**
	 * The attributes on the script/style tag
	 */
	attributes: Record<string, string | boolean>;
	/**
	 * The whole Svelte file content
	 */
	markup: string;
	/**
	 * The filename of the Svelte file
	 */
	filename?: string;
}) => Processed | void | Promise<Processed | void>;
PreprocessorGroup
A preprocessor group is a set of preprocessors that are applied to a Svelte file.

interface PreprocessorGroup {…}
name?: string;
Name of the preprocessor. Will be a required option in the next major version

markup?: MarkupPreprocessor;
style?: Preprocessor;
script?: Preprocessor;
Processed
The result of a preprocessor run. If the preprocessor does not return a result, it is assumed that the code is unchanged.

interface Processed {…}
code: string;
The new code

map?: string | object;
A source map mapping back to the original code

dependencies?: string[];
A list of additional files to watch for changes

attributes?: Record<string, string | boolean>;
Only for script/style preprocessors: The updated attributes to set on the tag. If undefined, attributes stay unchanged.

toString?: () => string;
Warning
interface Warning extends ICompileDiagnostic {}

LegacyComponentType
This module provides various functions for use during the migration, since some features can’t be replaced one to one with new features. All imports are marked as deprecated and should be migrated away from over time.


import {
	asClassComponent,
	createBubbler,
	createClassComponent,
	run,
	self,
	stopImmediatePropagation,
	stopPropagation,
	trusted
} from 'svelte/legacy';
asClassComponent
Use this only as a temporary solution to migrate your imperative component code to Svelte 5.

Takes the component function and returns a Svelte 4 compatible component constructor.

function asClassComponent<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>,
	Events extends Record<string, any>,
	Slots extends Record<string, any>
>(
	component:
		| SvelteComponent<Props, Events, Slots>
		| Component<Props>
): ComponentType<
	SvelteComponent<Props, Events, Slots> & Exports
>;
createBubbler
Use this only as a temporary solution to migrate your automatically delegated events in Svelte 5.

Function to create a bubble function that mimic the behavior of on:click without handler available in svelte 4.

function createBubbler(): (
	type: string
) => (event: Event) => boolean;
createClassComponent
Use this only as a temporary solution to migrate your imperative component code to Svelte 5.

Takes the same options as a Svelte 4 component and the component function and returns a Svelte 4 compatible component.

function createClassComponent<
	Props extends Record<string, any>,
	Exports extends Record<string, any>,
	Events extends Record<string, any>,
	Slots extends Record<string, any>
>(
	options: ComponentConstructorOptions<Props> & {
		component:
			| ComponentType<SvelteComponent<Props, Events, Slots>>
			| Component<Props>;
	}
): SvelteComponent<Props, Events, Slots> & Exports;
handlers
Function to mimic the multiple listeners available in svelte 4

function handlers(
	...handlers: EventListener[]
): EventListener;
nonpassive
Substitute for the nonpassive event modifier, implemented as an action

function nonpassive(
	node: HTMLElement,
	[event, handler]: [
		event: string,
		handler: () => EventListener
	]
): void;
once
Substitute for the once event modifier

function once(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
passive
Substitute for the passive event modifier, implemented as an action

function passive(
	node: HTMLElement,
	[event, handler]: [
		event: string,
		handler: () => EventListener
	]
): void;
preventDefault
Substitute for the preventDefault event modifier

function preventDefault(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
run
Use this only as a temporary solution to migrate your component code to Svelte 5.

Runs the given function once immediately on the server, and works like $effect.pre on the client.

function run(fn: () => void | (() => void)): void;
self
Substitute for the self event modifier

function self(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
stopImmediatePropagation
Substitute for the stopImmediatePropagation event modifier

function stopImmediatePropagation(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
stopPropagation
Substitute for the stopPropagation event modifier

function stopPropagation(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
trusted
Substitute for the trusted event modifier

function trusted(
	fn: (event: Event, ...args: Array<unknown>) => void
): (event: Event, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
LegacyComponentType
Support using the component as both a class and function during the transition period

type LegacyComponentType = {
	new (o: ComponentConstructorOptions): SvelteComponent;
	(
		...args: Parameters<Component<Record<string, any>>>

Tweened

import {
	Spring,
	Tween,
	prefersReducedMotion,
	spring,
	tweened
} from 'svelte/motion';
Spring
Available since 5.8.0

A wrapper for a value that behaves in a spring-like fashion. Changes to spring.target will cause spring.current to move towards it over time, taking account of the spring.stiffness and spring.damping parameters.


<script>
	import { Spring } from 'svelte/motion';

	const spring = new Spring(0);
</script>

<input type="range" bind:value={spring.target} />
<input type="range" bind:value={spring.current} disabled />
class Spring<T> {…}
constructor(value: T, options?: SpringOpts);
static of<U>(fn: () => U, options?: SpringOpts): Spring<U>;
Create a spring whose value is bound to the return value of fn. This must be called inside an effect root (for example, during component initialisation).


<script>
	import { Spring } from 'svelte/motion';

	let { number } = $props();

	const spring = Spring.of(() => number);
</script>
set(value: T, options?: SpringUpdateOpts): Promise<void>;
Sets spring.target to value and returns a Promise that resolves if and when spring.current catches up to it.

If options.instant is true, spring.current immediately matches spring.target.

If options.preserveMomentum is provided, the spring will continue on its current trajectory for the specified number of milliseconds. This is useful for things like ‘fling’ gestures.

damping: number;
precision: number;
stiffness: number;
target: T;
The end value of the spring. This property only exists on the Spring class, not the legacy spring store.

get current(): T;
The current value of the spring. This property only exists on the Spring class, not the legacy spring store.

Tween
Available since 5.8.0

A wrapper for a value that tweens smoothly to its target value. Changes to tween.target will cause tween.current to move towards it over time, taking account of the delay, duration and easing options.


<script>
	import { Tween } from 'svelte/motion';

	const tween = new Tween(0);
</script>

<input type="range" bind:value={tween.target} />
<input type="range" bind:value={tween.current} disabled />
class Tween<T> {…}
static of<U>(fn: () => U, options?: TweenedOptions<U> | undefined): Tween<U>;
Create a tween whose value is bound to the return value of fn. This must be called inside an effect root (for example, during component initialisation).


<script>
	import { Tween } from 'svelte/motion';

	let { number } = $props();

	const tween = Tween.of(() => number);
</script>
constructor(value: T, options?: TweenedOptions<T>);
set(value: T, options?: TweenedOptions<T> | undefined): Promise<void>;
Sets tween.target to value and returns a Promise that resolves if and when tween.current catches up to it.

If options are provided, they will override the tween’s defaults.

get current(): T;
set target(v: T);
get target(): T;
prefersReducedMotion
Available since 5.7.0

A media query that matches if the user prefers reduced motion.


<script>
	import { prefersReducedMotion } from 'svelte/motion';
	import { fly } from 'svelte/transition';

	let visible = $state(false);
</script>

<button onclick={() => visible = !visible}>
	toggle
</button>

{#if visible}
	<p transition:fly={{ y: prefersReducedMotion.current ? 0 : 200 }}>
		flies in, unless the user prefers reduced motion
	</p>
{/if}
const prefersReducedMotion: MediaQuery;
spring
Use Spring instead

The spring function in Svelte creates a store whose value is animated, with a motion that simulates the behavior of a spring. This means when the value changes, instead of transitioning at a steady rate, it “bounces” like a spring would, depending on the physics parameters provided. This adds a level of realism to the transitions and can enhance the user experience.

function spring<T = any>(
	value?: T | undefined,
	opts?: SpringOpts | undefined
): Spring<T>;
tweened
Use Tween instead

A tweened store in Svelte is a special type of store that provides smooth transitions between state values over time.

function tweened<T>(
	value?: T | undefined,
	defaults?: TweenedOptions<T> | undefined
): Tweened<T>;
Spring
interface Spring<T> extends Readable<T> {…}
set(new_value: T, opts?: SpringUpdateOpts): Promise<void>;
update: (fn: Updater<T>, opts?: SpringUpdateOpts) => Promise<void>;
deprecated Only exists on the legacy spring store, not the Spring class
subscribe(fn: (value: T) => void): Unsubscriber;
deprecated Only exists on the legacy spring store, not the Spring class
precision: number;
damping: number;
stiffness: number;
Tweened
interface Tweened<T> extends Readable<T> {…}
set(value: T, opts?: TweenedOptions<T>): Promise<void>;
update(updater: Updater<T>, opts?: TweenedOptions<T>): Promise<void>;

This module exports reactive versions of various window values, each of which has a reactive current property that you can reference in reactive contexts (templates, deriveds and effects) without using <svelte:window> bindings or manually creating your own event listeners.


<script>
	import { innerWidth, innerHeight } from 'svelte/reactivity/window';

MediaQuery
SvelteDate
SvelteMap
SvelteSet
SvelteURL
SvelteURLSearchParams
createSubscriber
Svelte provides reactive versions of various built-ins like Map, Set and URL that can be used just like their native counterparts, as well as a handful of additional utilities for handling reactivity.


import {
	MediaQuery,
	SvelteDate,
	SvelteMap,
	SvelteSet,
	SvelteURL,
	SvelteURLSearchParams,
	createSubscriber
} from 'svelte/reactivity';
MediaQuery
Available since 5.7.0

Creates a media query and provides a current property that reflects whether or not it matches.

Use it carefully — during server-side rendering, there is no way to know what the correct value should be, potentially causing content to change upon hydration. If you can use the media query in CSS to achieve the same effect, do that.


<script>
	import { MediaQuery } from 'svelte/reactivity';

	const large = new MediaQuery('min-width: 800px');
</script>

<h1>{large.current ? 'large screen' : 'small screen'}</h1>
class MediaQuery extends ReactiveValue<boolean> {…}
constructor(query: string, fallback?: boolean | undefined);
query A media query string
fallback Fallback value for the server
SvelteDate
A reactive version of the built-in Date object. Reading the date (whether with methods like date.getTime() or date.toString(), or via things like Intl.DateTimeFormat) in an effect or derived will cause it to be re-evaluated when the value of the date changes.


<script>
	import { SvelteDate } from 'svelte/reactivity';

	const date = new SvelteDate();

	const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined, {
	  hour: 'numeric',
	  minute: 'numeric',
	  second: 'numeric'
	});

	$effect(() => {
		const interval = setInterval(() => {
			date.setTime(Date.now());
		}, 1000);

		return () => {
			clearInterval(interval);
		};
	});
</script>

<p>The time is {formatter.format(date)}</p>
class SvelteDate extends Date {…}
constructor(...params: any[]);
SvelteMap
A reactive version of the built-in Map object. Reading contents of the map (by iterating, or by reading map.size or calling map.get(...) or map.has(...) as in the tic-tac-toe example below) in an effect or derived will cause it to be re-evaluated as necessary when the map is updated.

Note that values in a reactive map are not made deeply reactive.


<script>
	import { SvelteMap } from 'svelte/reactivity';
	import { result } from './game.js';

	let board = new SvelteMap();
	let player = $state('x');
	let winner = $derived(result(board));

	function reset() {
		player = 'x';
		board.clear();
	}
</script>

<div class="board">
	{#each Array(9), i}
		<button
			disabled={board.has(i) || winner}
			onclick={() => {
				board.set(i, player);
				player = player === 'x' ? 'o' : 'x';
			}}
		>{board.get(i)}</button>
	{/each}
</div>

{#if winner}
	<p>{winner} wins!</p>
	<button onclick={reset}>reset</button>
{:else}
	<p>{player} is next</p>
{/if}
class SvelteMap<K, V> extends Map<K, V> {…}
constructor(value?: Iterable<readonly [K, V]> | null | undefined);
set(key: K, value: V): this;
SvelteSet
A reactive version of the built-in Set object. Reading contents of the set (by iterating, or by reading set.size or calling set.has(...) as in the example below) in an effect or derived will cause it to be re-evaluated as necessary when the set is updated.

Note that values in a reactive set are not made deeply reactive.


<script>
	import { SvelteSet } from 'svelte/reactivity';
	let monkeys = new SvelteSet();

	function toggle(monkey) {
		if (monkeys.has(monkey)) {
			monkeys.delete(monkey);
		} else {
			monkeys.add(monkey);
		}
	}
</script>

{#each ['🙈', '🙉', '🙊'] as monkey}
	<button onclick={() => toggle(monkey)}>{monkey}</button>
{/each}

<button onclick={() => monkeys.clear()}>clear</button>

{#if monkeys.has('🙈')}<p>see no evil</p>{/if}
{#if monkeys.has('🙉')}<p>hear no evil</p>{/if}

SvelteURL
A reactive version of the built-in URL object. Reading properties of the URL (such as url.href or url.pathname) in an effect or derived will cause it to be re-evaluated as necessary when the URL changes.

The searchParams property is an instance of SvelteURLSearchParams.

Example:


<script>
	import { SvelteURL } from 'svelte/reactivity';

	const url = new SvelteURL('https://example.com/path');
</script>

<!-- changes to these... -->
<input bind:value={url.protocol} />
<input bind:value={url.hostname} />
<input bind:value={url.pathname} />

<hr />

<!-- will update `href` and vice versa -->
<input bind:value={url.href} size="65" />
class SvelteURL extends URL {…}
get searchParams(): SvelteURLSearchParams;
SvelteURLSearchParams
A reactive version of the built-in URLSearchParams object. Reading its contents (by iterating, or by calling params.get(...) or params.getAll(...) as in the example below) in an effect or derived will cause it to be re-evaluated as necessary when the params are updated.


<script>
	import { SvelteURLSearchParams } from 'svelte/reactivity';

	const params = new SvelteURLSearchParams('message=hello');

	let key = $state('key');
	let value = $state('value');
</script>

<input bind:value={key} />
<input bind:value={value} />
<button onclick={() => params.append(key, value)}>append</button>

<p>?{params.toString()}</p>

{#each params as [key, value]}
	<p>{key}: {value}</p>
{/each}
class SvelteURLSearchParams extends URLSearchParams {…}
[REPLACE](params: URLSearchParams): void;
createSubscriber
Available since 5.7.0

Returns a subscribe function that integrates external event-based systems with Svelte’s reactivity. It’s particularly useful for integrating with web APIs like MediaQuery, IntersectionObserver, or WebSocket.

If subscribe is called inside an effect (including indirectly, for example inside a getter), the start callback will be called with an update function. Whenever update is called, the effect re-runs.

If start returns a cleanup function, it will be called when the effect is destroyed.

If subscribe is called in multiple effects, start will only be called once as long as the effects are active, and the returned teardown function will only be called when all effects are destroyed.

It’s best understood with an example. Here’s an implementation of MediaQuery:


import { createSubscriber } from 'svelte/reactivity';
import { on } from 'svelte/events';

export class MediaQuery {
	#query;
	#subscribe;

	constructor(query) {
		this.#query = window.matchMedia(`(${query})`);

		this.#subscribe = createSubscriber((update) => {
			// when the `change` event occurs, re-run any effects that read `this.current`
			const off = on(this.#query, 'change', update);

			// stop listening when all the effects are destroyed
			return () => off();
		});
	}

	get current() {
		// This makes the getter reactive, if read in an effect
		this.#subscribe();

		// Return the current state of the query, whether or not we're in an effect
		return this.#query.matches;
	}
}
function createSubscriber(
	start: (update: () => void) => (() => void) | void
): () => void;

import {

} from 'svelte/transition';
blur
Animates a blur filter alongside an element’s opacity.

function blur(
	node: Element,
	{
		delay,
		duration,
		easing,
		amount,
		opacity
	}?: BlurParams | undefined
): TransitionConfig;
crossfade
The crossfade function creates a pair of transitions called send and receive. When an element is ‘sent’, it looks for a corresponding element being ‘received’, and generates a transition that transforms the element to its counterpart’s position and fades it out. When an element is ‘received’, the reverse happens. If there is no counterpart, the fallback transition is used.

function crossfade({
	fallback,
	...defaults
}: CrossfadeParams & {
	fallback?: (
		node: Element,
		params: CrossfadeParams,
		intro: boolean
	) => TransitionConfig;
}): [
	(
		node: any,
		params: CrossfadeParams & {
			key: any;
		}
	) => () => TransitionConfig,
	(
		node: any,
		params: CrossfadeParams & {
			key: any;
		}
	) => () => TransitionConfig
];
draw
Animates the stroke of an SVG element, like a snake in a tube. in transitions begin with the path invisible and draw the path to the screen over time. out transitions start in a visible state and gradually erase the path. draw only works with elements that have a getTotalLength method, like <path> and <polyline>.

function draw(
	node: SVGElement & {
		getTotalLength(): number;
	},
	{
		delay,
		speed,
		duration,
		easing
	}?: DrawParams | undefined
): TransitionConfig;
fade
Animates the opacity of an element from 0 to the current opacity for in transitions and from the current opacity to 0 for out transitions.

function fade(
	node: Element,
	{ delay, duration, easing }?: FadeParams | undefined
): TransitionConfig;
fly
Animates the x and y positions and the opacity of an element. in transitions animate from the provided values, passed as parameters to the element’s default values. out transitions animate from the element’s default values to the provided values.

function fly(
	node: Element,
	{
		delay,
		duration,
		easing,
		x,
		y,
		opacity
	}?: FlyParams | undefined
): TransitionConfig;
scale
Animates the opacity and scale of an element. in transitions animate from the provided values, passed as parameters, to an element’s current (default) values. out transitions animate from an element’s default values to the provided values.

function scale(
	node: Element,
	{
		delay,
		duration,
		easing,
		start,
		opacity
	}?: ScaleParams | undefined
): TransitionConfig;

Overview
Svelte 5 introduced some significant changes to Svelte’s API, including runes, snippets and event attributes. As a result, some Svelte 3/4 features are deprecated (though supported for now, unless otherwise specified) and will eventually be removed. We recommend that you incrementally migrate your existing code.

The following pages document these features for

people still using Svelte 3/4
people using Svelte 5, but with components that haven’t yet been migrated
Since Svelte 3/4 syntax still works in Svelte 5, we will distinguish between legacy mode and runes mode. Once a component is in runes mode (which you can opt into by using runes, or by explicitly setting the runes: true compiler option), legacy mode features are no longer available.

If you’re exclusively interested in the Svelte 3/4 syntax, you can browse its documentation at v4.svelte.dev.

Reactive let/var declarations
In runes mode, reactive state is explicitly declared with the $state rune.

In legacy mode, variables declared at the top level of a component are automatically considered reactive. Reassigning or mutating these variables (count += 1 or object.x = y) will cause the UI to update.


<script>
	let count = 0;
</script>

<button on:click={() => count += 1}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
Because Svelte’s legacy mode reactivity is based on assignments, using array methods like .push() and .splice() won’t automatically trigger updates. A subsequent assignment is required to ‘tell’ the compiler to update the UI:


<script>
	let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

	function addNumber() {
		// this method call does not trigger an update
		numbers.push(numbers.length + 1);

		// this assignment will update anything
		// that depends on `numbers`
		numbers = numbers;
	}
</script>

Reactive $: statements
Understanding dependencies
Browser-only code
In runes mode, reactions to state updates are handled with the $derived and $effect runes.

In legacy mode, any top-level statement (i.e. not inside a block or a function) can be made reactive by prefixing it with a $: label. These statements run after other code in the <script> and before the component markup is rendered, then whenever the values that they depend on change.


<script>
	let a = 1;
	let b = 2;

	// this is a 'reactive statement', and it will re-run
	// when `a`, `b` or `sum` change
	$: console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${sum}`);

	// this is a 'reactive assignment' — `sum` will be
	// recalculated when `a` or `b` change. It is
	// not necessary to declare `sum` separately
	$: sum = a + b;
</script>
Statements are ordered topologically by their dependencies and their assignments: since the console.log statement depends on sum, sum is calculated first even though it appears later in the source.

Multiple statements can be combined by putting them in a block:


$: {
	// recalculate `total` when `items` changes
	total = 0;

	for (const item of items) {
		total += item.value;
	}
}
The left-hand side of a reactive assignments can be an identifier, or it can be a destructuring assignment:


$: ({ larry, moe, curly } = stooges);
Understanding dependencies
The dependencies of a $: statement are determined at compile time — they are whichever variables are referenced (but not assigned to) inside the statement.

In other words, a statement like this will not re-run when count changes, because the compiler cannot ‘see’ the dependency:


let count = 0;
let double = () => count * 2;

$: doubled = double();
Similarly, topological ordering will fail if dependencies are referenced indirectly: z will never update, because y is not considered ‘dirty’ when the update occurs. Moving $: z = y below $: setY(x) will fix it:


<script>
	let x = 0;
	let y = 0;

	$: z = y;
	$: setY(x);

	function setY(value) {
		y = value;
	}
</script>
Browser-only code
Reactive statements run during server-side rendering as well as in the browser. This means that any code that should only run in the browser must be wrapped in an if block:


$: if (browser) {
	document.title = title;
}

Component exports
Renaming props
In runes mode, component props are declared with the $props rune, allowing parent components to pass in data.

In legacy mode, props are marked with the export keyword, and can have a default value:


<script>
	export let foo;
	export let bar = 'default value';

	// Values that are passed in as props
	// are immediately available
	console.log({ foo });
</script>
The default value is used if it would otherwise be undefined when the component is created.

Unlike in runes mode, if the parent component changes a prop from a defined value to undefined, it does not revert to the initial value.

Props without default values are considered required, and Svelte will print a warning during development if no value is provided, which you can squelch by specifying undefined as the default value:


export let foo = undefined;
Component exports
An exported const, class or function declaration is not considered a prop — instead, it becomes part of the component’s API:

Greeter

<script lang="ts">
	export function greet(name) {
		alert(`hello ${name}!`);
	}
</script>
App

<script lang="ts">
	import Greeter from './Greeter.svelte';

	let greeter;
</script>

<Greeter bind:this={greeter} />

<button on:click={() => greeter.greet('world')}>
	greet
</button>
Renaming props
The export keyword can appear separately from the declaration. This is useful for renaming props, for example in the case of a reserved word:

App

<script lang="ts">
	let className: string;

	// creates a `class` property, even
	// though it is a reserved word
	export { className as class };
</script>

$$props and $$restProps
In runes mode, getting an object containing all the props that were passed in is easy, using the $props rune.

In legacy mode, we use $$props and $$restProps:

$$props contains all the props that were passed in, including ones that are not individually declared with the export keyword
$$restProps contains all the props that were passed in except the ones that were individually declared
For example, a <Button> component might need to pass along all its props to its own <button> element, except the variant prop:


<script>
	export let variant;
</script>

<button {...$$restProps} class="variant-{variant} {$$props.class ?? ''}">
	click me
</button>

<style>
	.variant-danger {
		background: red;
	}
</style>
In Svelte 3/4 using $$props and $$restProps creates a modest performance penalty, so they should only be used when needed.

Component events
In runes mode, event handlers are just like any other attribute or prop.

In legacy mode, we use the on: directive:

App

<script lang="ts">
	let count = 0;

	function handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {
		count += 1;
	}
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
	count: {count}
</button>
Handlers can be declared inline with no performance penalty:


<button on:click={() => (count += 1)}>
	count: {count}
</button>
Add modifiers to element event handlers with the | character.


<form on:submit|preventDefault={handleSubmit}>
	<!-- the `submit` event's default is prevented,
	     so the page won't reload -->
</form>
The following modifiers are available:

preventDefault — calls event.preventDefault() before running the handler
stopPropagation — calls event.stopPropagation(), preventing the event reaching the next element
stopImmediatePropagation - calls event.stopImmediatePropagation(), preventing other listeners of the same event from being fired.
passive — improves scrolling performance on touch/wheel events (Svelte will add it automatically where it’s safe to do so)
nonpassive — explicitly set passive: false
capture — fires the handler during the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase
once — remove the handler after the first time it runs
self — only trigger handler if event.target is the element itself
trusted — only trigger handler if event.isTrusted is true. I.e. if the event is triggered by a user action.
Modifiers can be chained together, e.g. on:click|once|capture={...}.

If the on: directive is used without a value, the component will forward the event, meaning that a consumer of the component can listen for it.


<button on:click>
	The component itself will emit the click event
</button>
It’s possible to have multiple event listeners for the same event:

App

<script lang="ts">
	let count = 0;

	function increment() {
		count += 1;
	}

	function log(event: MouseEvent) {
		console.log(event);
	}
</script>

<button on:click={increment} on:click={log}>
	clicks: {count}
</button>
Component events
Components can dispatch events by creating a dispatcher when they are initialised:

Stepper

<script lang="ts">
	import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';
	const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();
</script>

<button on:click={() => dispatch('decrement')}>decrement</button>
<button on:click={() => dispatch('increment')}>increment</button>
dispatch creates a CustomEvent. If a second argument is provided, it becomes the detail property of the event object.

A consumer of this component can listen for the dispatched events:


<script>
	import Stepper from './Stepper.svelte';

	let n = 0;
</script>

<Stepper
	on:decrement={() => n -= 1}
	on:increment={() => n += 1}
/>

<p>n: {n}</p>
Component events do not bubble — a parent component can only listen for events on its immediate children.

Other than once, modifiers are not valid on component event handlers.

If you’re planning an eventual migration to Svelte 5, use callback props instead. This will make upgrading easier as createEventDispatcher is deprecated:

Stepper

<script lang="ts">
	export let decrement;
	export let increment;
</script>

<button on:click={decrement}>decrement</button>
<button on:click={increment}>increment</button>

Named slots
Fallback content
Passing data to slotted content
In Svelte 5, content can be passed to components in the form of snippets and rendered using render tags.

In legacy mode, content inside component tags is considered slotted content, which can be rendered by the component using a <slot> element:

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Modal from './Modal.svelte';
</script>

<Modal>This is some slotted content</Modal>
Modal

<div class="modal">
	<slot></slot>
</div>
If you want to render a regular <slot> element, you can use <svelte:element this={'slot'} />.

Named slots
A component can have named slots in addition to the default slot. On the parent side, add a slot="..." attribute to an element, component or <svelte:fragment> directly inside the component tags.

App

<script lang="ts">
	import Modal from './Modal.svelte';

	let open = true;
</script>

{#if open}
	<Modal>
		This is some slotted content

		<div slot="buttons">
			<button on:click={() => open = false}>
				close
			</button>
		</div>
	</Modal>
{/if}
On the child side, add a corresponding <slot name="..."> element:

Modal

<div class="modal">
	<slot></slot>
	<hr>
	<slot name="buttons"></slot>
</div>
Fallback content
If no slotted content is provided, a component can define fallback content by putting it inside the <slot> element:


<slot>
	This will be rendered if no slotted content is provided
</slot>
Passing data to slotted content
Slots can be rendered zero or more times and can pass values back to the parent using props. The parent exposes the values to the slot template using the let: directive.

FancyList

<ul>
	{#each items as data}
		<li class="fancy">
			<!-- 'item' here... -->
			<slot item={process(data)} />
		</li>
	{/each}
</ul>
App

<!-- ...corresponds to 'item' here: -->
<FancyList {items} let:item={processed}>
	<div>{processed.text}</div>
</FancyList>
The usual shorthand rules apply — let:item is equivalent to let:item={item}, and <slot {item}> is equivalent to <slot item={item}>.

Named slots can also expose values. The let: directive goes on the element with the slot attribute.

FancyList

<ul>
	{#each items as item}
		<li class="fancy">
			<slot name="item" item={process(data)} />
		</li>
	{/each}
</ul>

<slot name="footer" />
App

<FancyList {items}>
	<div slot="item" let:item>{item.text}</div>
	<p slot="footer">Copyright (c) 2019 Svelte Industries</p>

$$slots
In runes mode, we know which snippets were provided to a component, as they’re just normal props.

In legacy mode, the way to know if content was provided for a given slot is with the $$slots object, whose keys are the names of the slots passed into the component by the parent.

<svelte:fragment>
The <svelte:fragment> element allows you to place content in a named slot without wrapping it in a container DOM element. This keeps the flow layout of your document intact.

Widget

<div>
	<slot name="header">No header was provided</slot>
	<p>Some content between header and footer</p>
	<slot name="footer" />
</div>

<script lang="ts">

In Svelte 5+, this concept is obsolete, as snippets don’t create a wrapping element

In runes mode, <MyComponent> will re-render if the value of MyComponent changes. See the Svelte 5 migration guide for an example.

In legacy mode, it won’t — we must use <svelte:component>, which destroys and recreates the component instance when the value of its this expression changes:


<svelte:component this={MyComponent} />
If this is falsy, no component is rendered.

Creating a component

Component props
Server-side component API
In Svelte 3 and 4, the API for interacting with a component is different than in Svelte 5. Note that this page does not apply to legacy mode components in a Svelte 5 application.

Creating a component

const component = new Component(options);
A client-side component — that is, a component compiled with generate: 'dom' (or the generate option left unspecified) is a JavaScript class.


import App from './App.svelte';

const app = new App({
	target: document.body,
	props: {
		// assuming App.svelte contains something like
		// `export let answer`:
		answer: 42
	}
});
The following initialisation options can be provided:

option	default	description
target	none	An HTMLElement or ShadowRoot to render to. This option is required
anchor	null	A child of target to render the component immediately before
props	{}	An object of properties to supply to the component
context	new Map()	A Map of root-level context key-value pairs to supply to the component
hydrate	false	See below
intro	false	If true, will play transitions on initial render, rather than waiting for subsequent state changes
Existing children of target are left where they are.

The hydrate option instructs Svelte to upgrade existing DOM (usually from server-side rendering) rather than creating new elements. It will only work if the component was compiled with the hydratable: true option. Hydration of <head> elements only works properly if the server-side rendering code was also compiled with hydratable: true, which adds a marker to each element in the <head> so that the component knows which elements it’s responsible for removing during hydration.

Whereas children of target are normally left alone, hydrate: true will cause any children to be removed. For that reason, the anchor option cannot be used alongside hydrate: true.

The existing DOM doesn’t need to match the component — Svelte will ‘repair’ the DOM as it goes.

index

import App from './App.svelte';

const app = new App({
	target: document.querySelector('#server-rendered-html'),
	hydrate: true
});
In Svelte 5+, use mount instead

$set

component.$set(props);
Programmatically sets props on an instance. component.$set({ x: 1 }) is equivalent to x = 1 inside the component’s <script> block.

Calling this method schedules an update for the next microtask — the DOM is not updated synchronously.


component.$set({ answer: 42 });
In Svelte 5+, use $state instead to create a component props and update that


let props = $state({ answer: 42 });
const component = mount(Component, { props });
// ...
props.answer = 24;
$on

component.$on(ev, callback);
Causes the callback function to be called whenever the component dispatches an event.

A function is returned that will remove the event listener when called.


const off = component.$on('selected', (event) => {
	console.log(event.detail.selection);
});

off();
In Svelte 5+, pass callback props instead

$destroy

component.$destroy();
Removes a component from the DOM and triggers any onDestroy handlers.

In Svelte 5+, use unmount instead

Component props

component.prop;

component.prop = value;
If a component is compiled with accessors: true, each instance will have getters and setters corresponding to each of the component’s props. Setting a value will cause a synchronous update, rather than the default async update caused by component.$set(...).

By default, accessors is false, unless you’re compiling as a custom element.


console.log(component.count);
component.count += 1;
In Svelte 5+, this concept is obsolete. If you want to make properties accessible from the outside, export them

Server-side component API

const result = Component.render(...)
Unlike client-side components, server-side components don’t have a lifespan after you render them — their whole job is to create some HTML and CSS. For that reason, the API is somewhat different.

A server-side component exposes a render method that can be called with optional props. It returns an object with head, html, and css properties, where head contains the contents of any <svelte:head> elements encountered.

You can import a Svelte component directly into Node using svelte/register.


require('svelte/register');

const App = require('./App.svelte').default;

const { head, html, css } = App.render({
	answer: 42
});
The .render() method accepts the following parameters:

parameter	default	description
props	{}	An object of properties to supply to the component
options	{}	An object of options
The options object takes in the following options:

option	default	description
context	new Map()	A Map of root-level context key-value pairs to supply to the component

const { head, html, css } = App.render(
	// props
	{ answer: 42 },
	// options
	{
		context: new Map([['context-key', 'context-value']])
	}
);
In Svelte 5+, use render instead

Introduction

Introduction
Before we begin
What is SvelteKit?
What is Svelte?
SvelteKit vs Svelte
Before we begin
If you’re new to Svelte or SvelteKit we recommend checking out the interactive tutorial.

If you get stuck, reach out for help in the Discord chatroom.

What is SvelteKit?
SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. If you’re coming from React, SvelteKit is similar to Next. If you’re coming from Vue, SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt.

To learn more about the kinds of applications you can build with SvelteKit, see the documentation regarding project types.

What is Svelte?
In short, Svelte is a way of writing user interface components — like a navigation bar, comment section, or contact form — that users see and interact with in their browsers. The Svelte compiler converts your components to JavaScript that can be run to render the HTML for the page and to CSS that styles the page. You don’t need to know Svelte to understand the rest of this guide, but it will help. If you’d like to learn more, check out the Svelte tutorial.

SvelteKit vs Svelte
Svelte renders UI components. You can compose these components and render an entire page with just Svelte, but you need more than just Svelte to write an entire app.

SvelteKit helps you build web apps while following modern best practices and providing solutions to common development challenges. It offers everything from basic functionalities — like a router that updates your UI when a link is clicked — to more advanced capabilities. Its extensive list of features includes build optimizations to load only the minimal required code; offline support; preloading pages before user navigation; configurable rendering to handle different parts of your app on the server via SSR, in the browser through client-side rendering, or at build-time with prerendering; image optimization; and much more. Building an app with all the modern best practices is fiendishly complicated, but SvelteKit does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.

It reflects changes to your code in the browser instantly to provide a lightning-fast and feature-rich development experience by leveraging Vite with a Svelte plugin to do Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

SvelteKitGetting started
Creating a project
On this page
Creating a project
Editor setup
The easiest way to start building a SvelteKit app is to run npx sv create:


npx sv create my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
The first command will scaffold a new project in the my-app directory asking if you’d like to set up some basic tooling such as TypeScript. See the CLI docs for information about these options and the integrations page for pointers on setting up additional tooling. npm run dev will then start the development server on localhost:5173 - make sure you install dependencies before running this if you didn’t do so during project creation.

There are two basic concepts:

Each page of your app is a Svelte component
You create pages by adding files to the src/routes directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user’s first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over
Try editing the files to get a feel for how everything works.

Editor setup
We recommend using Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) with the Svelte extension, but support also exists for numerous other editors.

Single-page app

Browser extension
Embedded device
SvelteKit offers configurable rendering, which allows you to build and deploy your project in several different ways. You can build all of the below types of applications and more with SvelteKit. Rendering settings are not mutually exclusive and you may choose the optimal manner with which to render different parts of your application.

If you don’t have a particular way you’d like to build your application in mind, don’t worry! The way your application is built, deployed, and rendered is controlled by which adapter you’ve chosen and a small amount of configuration and these can always be changed later. The project structure and routing will be the same regardless of the project type that you choose.

Default rendering
By default, when a user visits a site, SvelteKit will render the first page with server-side rendering (SSR) and subsequent pages with client-side rendering (CSR). Using SSR for the initial render improves SEO and perceived performance of the initial page load. Client-side rendering then takes over and updates the page without having to rerender common components, which is typically faster and eliminates a flash when navigating between pages. Apps built with this hybrid rendering approach have also been called transitional apps.

Static site generation
You can use SvelteKit as a static site generator (SSG) that fully prerenders your site with static rendering using adapter-static. You may also use the prerender option to prerender only some pages and then choose a different adapter with which to dynamically server-render other pages.

Tools built solely to do static site generation may scale the prerendering process more efficiently during build when rendering a very large number of pages. When working with very large statically generated sites, you can avoid long build times with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) if using adapter-vercel. And in contrast to purpose-built SSGs, SvelteKit allows for nicely mixing and matching different rendering types on different pages.

Single-page app
Single-page apps (SPAs) exclusively use client-side rendering (CSR). You can build single-page apps (SPAs) with SvelteKit. As with all types of SvelteKit applications, you can write your backend in SvelteKit or another language or framework. If you are building an application with no backend or a separate backend, you can simply skip over and ignore the parts of the docs talking about server files.

Multi-page app
SvelteKit isn’t typically used to build traditional multi-page apps. However, in SvelteKit you can remove all JavaScript on a page with csr = false, which will render subsequent links on the server, or you can use data-sveltekit-reload to render specific links on the server.

Separate backend
If your backend is written in another language such as Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, Rust, or C#, there are a couple of ways that you can deploy your application. The most recommended way would be to deploy your SvelteKit frontend separately from your backend utilizing adapter-node or a serverless adapter. Some users prefer not to have a separate process to manage and decide to deploy their application as a single-page app (SPA) served by their backend server, but note that single-page apps have worse SEO and performance characteristics.

If you are using an external backend, you can simply skip over and ignore the parts of the docs talking about server files. You may also want to reference the FAQ about how to make calls to a separate backend.

Serverless app
SvelteKit apps are simple to run on serverless platforms. The default zero config adapter will automatically run your app on a number of supported platforms or you can use adapter-vercel, adapter-netlify, or adapter-cloudflare to provide platform-specific configuration. And community adapters allow you to deploy your application to almost any serverless environment. Some of these adapters such as adapter-vercel and adapter-netlify offer an edge option, to support edge rendering for improved latency.

Your own server
You can deploy to your own server or VPS using adapter-node.

Container
You can use adapter-node to run a SvelteKit app within a container such as Docker or LXC.

Library
You can create a library to be used by other Svelte apps with the @sveltejs/package add-on to SvelteKit by choosing the library option when running sv create.

Offline app
SvelteKit has full support for service workers allowing you to build many types of applications such as offline apps and progressive web apps.

Mobile app
You can turn a SvelteKit SPA into a mobile app with Tauri or Capacitor. Mobile features like the camera, geolocation, and push notifications are available via plugins for both platforms.

These mobile development platforms work by starting a local web server and then serving your application like a static host on your phone. You may find bundleStrategy: 'single' to be a helpful option to limit the number of requests made. E.g. at the time of writing, the Capacitor local server uses HTTP/1, which limits the number of concurrent connections.

Desktop app
You can turn a SvelteKit SPA into a desktop app with Tauri, Wails, or Electron.

Browser extension
You can build browser extensions using either adapter-static or community adapters specifically tailored towards browser extensions.

Embedded device
Because of its efficient rendering, Svelte can be run on low power devices. Embedded devices like microcontrollers and TVs may limit the number of concurrent connections. In order to reduce the number of concurrent requests, you may find bundleStrategy: 'single' to be a helpful option in this deployment configuration.
Project structure
On this page
Project structure
Project files
Other files
A typical SvelteKit project looks like this:


my-project/
├ src/
│ ├ lib/
│ │ ├ server/
│ │ │ └ [your server-only lib files]
│ │ └ [your lib files]
│ ├ params/
│ │ └ [your param matchers]
│ ├ routes/
│ │ └ [your routes]
│ ├ app.html
│ ├ error.html

├ static/
│ └ [your static assets]
├ tests/
│ └ [your tests]
├ package.json
├ svelte.config.js
├ tsconfig.json
└ vite.config.js
You’ll also find common files like .gitignore and .npmrc (and .prettierrc and eslint.config.js and so on, if you chose those options when running npx sv create).

Project files
src
The src directory contains the meat of your project. Everything except src/routes and src/app.html is optional.

lib contains your library code (utilities and components), which can be imported via the $lib alias, or packaged up for distribution using svelte-package
server contains your server-only library code. It can be imported by using the $lib/server alias. SvelteKit will prevent you from importing these in client code.
params contains any param matchers your app needs
routes contains the routes of your application. You can also colocate other components that are only used within a single route here
app.html is your page template — an HTML document containing the following placeholders:
%sveltekit.head% — <link> and <script> elements needed by the app, plus any <svelte:head> content
%sveltekit.body% — the markup for a rendered page. This should live inside a <div> or other element, rather than directly inside <body>, to prevent bugs caused by browser extensions injecting elements that are then destroyed by the hydration process. SvelteKit will warn you in development if this is not the case
%sveltekit.assets% — either paths.assets, if specified, or a relative path to paths.base
%sveltekit.nonce% — a CSP nonce for manually included links and scripts, if used
%sveltekit.env.[NAME]% - this will be replaced at render time with the [NAME] environment variable, which must begin with the publicPrefix (usually PUBLIC_). It will fallback to '' if not matched.
%sveltekit.version% — the app version, which can be specified with the version configuration
error.html is the page that is rendered when everything else fails. It can contain the following placeholders:
%sveltekit.status% — the HTTP status
%sveltekit.error.message% — the error message
hooks.client.js contains your client hooks
hooks.server.js contains your server hooks
service-worker.js contains your service worker
instrumentation.server.js contains your observability setup and instrumentation code
Requires adapter support. If your adapter supports it, it is guarnteed to run prior to loading and running your application code.
(Whether the project contains .js or .ts files depends on whether you opt to use TypeScript when you create your project.)

If you added Vitest when you set up your project, your unit tests will live in the src directory with a .test.js extension.

static
Any static assets that should be served as-is, like robots.txt or favicon.png, go in here.

tests
If you added Playwright for browser testing when you set up your project, the tests will live in this directory.

package.json
Your package.json file must include @sveltejs/kit, svelte and vite as devDependencies.

When you create a project with npx sv create, you’ll also notice that package.json includes "type": "module". This means that .js files are interpreted as native JavaScript modules with import and export keywords. Legacy CommonJS files need a .cjs file extension.

svelte.config.js
This file contains your Svelte and SvelteKit configuration.

tsconfig.json
This file (or jsconfig.json, if you prefer type-checked .js files over .ts files) configures TypeScript, if you added typechecking during npx sv create. Since SvelteKit relies on certain configuration being set a specific way, it generates its own .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json file which your own config extends. To make changes to top-level options such as include and exclude, we recommend extending the generated config; see the typescript.config setting for more details.

vite.config.js
A SvelteKit project is really just a Vite project that uses the @sveltejs/kit/vite plugin, along with any other Vite configuration.

Other files
.svelte-kit
As you develop and build your project, SvelteKit will generate files in a .svelte-kit directory (configurable as outDir). You can ignore its contents, and delete them at any time (they will be regenerated when you next dev or build).

Web standards

Web standards
Fetch APIs
FormData
Stream APIs
URL APIs
Web Crypto
Throughout this documentation, you’ll see references to the standard Web APIs that SvelteKit builds on top of. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we use the platform, which means your existing web development skills are applicable to SvelteKit. Conversely, time spent learning SvelteKit will help you be a better web developer elsewhere.

These APIs are available in all modern browsers and in many non-browser environments like Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Vercel Functions. During development, and in adapters for Node-based environments (including AWS Lambda), they’re made available via polyfills where necessary (for now, that is — Node is rapidly adding support for more web standards).

In particular, you’ll get comfortable with the following:

Fetch APIs
SvelteKit uses fetch for getting data from the network. It’s available in hooks and server routes as well as in the browser.

A special version of fetch is available in load functions, server hooks and API routes for invoking endpoints directly during server-side rendering, without making an HTTP call, while preserving credentials. (To make credentialled fetches in server-side code outside load, you must explicitly pass cookie and/or authorization headers.) It also allows you to make relative requests, whereas server-side fetch normally requires a fully qualified URL.

Besides fetch itself, the Fetch API includes the following interfaces:

Request
An instance of Request is accessible in hooks and server routes as event.request. It contains useful methods like request.json() and request.formData() for getting data that was posted to an endpoint.

Response
An instance of Response is returned from await fetch(...) and handlers in +server.js files. Fundamentally, a SvelteKit app is a machine for turning a Request into a Response.

Headers
The Headers interface allows you to read incoming request.headers and set outgoing response.headers. For example, you can get the request.headers as shown below, and use the json convenience function to send modified response.headers:

src/routes/what-is-my-user-agent/+server

import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const GET: RequestHandler = ({ request }) => {
	// log all headers
	console.log(...request.headers);

	// create a JSON Response using a header we received
	return json({
		// retrieve a specific header
		userAgent: request.headers.get('user-agent')
	}, {
		// set a header on the response
		headers: { 'x-custom-header': 'potato' }
	});
};
FormData
When dealing with HTML native form submissions you’ll be working with FormData objects.

src/routes/hello/+server

import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const POST: RequestHandler = async (event) => {
	const body = await event.request.formData();

	// log all fields
	console.log([...body]);

	return json({
		// get a specific field's value
		name: body.get('name') ?? 'world'
	});
};
Stream APIs
Most of the time, your endpoints will return complete data, as in the userAgent example above. Sometimes, you may need to return a response that’s too large to fit in memory in one go, or is delivered in chunks, and for this the platform provides streams — ReadableStream, WritableStream and TransformStream.

URL APIs
URLs are represented by the URL interface, which includes useful properties like origin and pathname (and, in the browser, hash). This interface shows up in various places — event.url in hooks and server routes, page.url in pages, from and to in beforeNavigate and afterNavigate and so on.

URLSearchParams
Wherever you encounter a URL, you can access query parameters via url.searchParams, which is an instance of URLSearchParams:


const foo = url.searchParams.get('foo');
Web Crypto
The Web Crypto API is made available via the crypto global. It’s used internally for Content Security Policy headers, but you can also use it for things like generating UUIDs:


const uuid = crypto.randomUUID();
Routing

Routing

+error
+layout

Other files
Further reading
At the heart of SvelteKit is a filesystem-based router. The routes of your app — i.e. the URL paths that users can access — are defined by the directories in your codebase:

src/routes is the root route
src/routes/about creates an /about route
src/routes/blog/[slug] creates a route with a parameter, slug, that can be used to load data dynamically when a user requests a page like /blog/hello-world
You can change src/routes to a different directory by editing the project config.

Each route directory contains one or more route files, which can be identified by their + prefix.

We’ll introduce these files in a moment in more detail, but here are a few simple rules to help you remember how SvelteKit’s routing works:

All files can run on the server
All files run on the client except +server files
+layout and +error files apply to subdirectories as well as the directory they live in
+page
+page.svelte
A +page.svelte component defines a page of your app. By default, pages are rendered both on the server (SSR) for the initial request and in the browser (CSR) for subsequent navigation.

src/routes/+page

<h1>Hello and welcome to my site!</h1>
<a href="/about">About my site</a>
src/routes/about/+page

<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>TODO...</p>
<a href="/">Home</a>
SvelteKit uses <a> elements to navigate between routes, rather than a framework-specific <Link> component.

Pages can receive data from load functions via the data prop.

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<h1>{data.title}</h1>
<div>{@html data.content}</div>
PageProps was added in 2.16.0. In earlier versions, you had to type the data property manually with PageData instead, see $types.

In Svelte 4, you’d use export let data instead.

+page.js
Often, a page will need to load some data before it can be rendered. For this, we add a +page.js module that exports a load function:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = ({ params }) => {
	if (params.slug === 'hello-world') {
		return {
			title: 'Hello world!',
			content: 'Welcome to our blog. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'
		};
	}

	error(404, 'Not found');
};
This function runs alongside +page.svelte, which means it runs on the server during server-side rendering and in the browser during client-side navigation. See load for full details of the API.

As well as load, +page.js can export values that configure the page’s behaviour:

export const prerender = true or false or 'auto'
export const ssr = true or false
export const csr = true or false
You can find more information about these in page options.

+page.server.js
If your load function can only run on the server — for example, if it needs to fetch data from a database or you need to access private environment variables like API keys — then you can rename +page.js to +page.server.js and change the PageLoad type to PageServerLoad.

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ params }) => {
	const post = await getPostFromDatabase(params.slug);

	if (post) {
		return post;
	}

	error(404, 'Not found');
};
During client-side navigation, SvelteKit will load this data from the server, which means that the returned value must be serializable using devalue. See load for full details of the API.

Like +page.js, +page.server.js can export page options — prerender, ssr and csr.

A +page.server.js file can also export actions. If load lets you read data from the server, actions let you write data to the server using the <form> element. To learn how to use them, see the form actions section.

+error
If an error occurs during load, SvelteKit will render a default error page. You can customise this error page on a per-route basis by adding an +error.svelte file:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+error

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

<h1>{page.status}: {page.error.message}</h1>
$app/state was added in SvelteKit 2.12. If you’re using an earlier version or are using Svelte 4, use $app/stores instead.

SvelteKit will ‘walk up the tree’ looking for the closest error boundary — if the file above didn’t exist it would try src/routes/blog/+error.svelte and then src/routes/+error.svelte before rendering the default error page. If that fails (or if the error was thrown from the load function of the root +layout, which sits ‘above’ the root +error), SvelteKit will bail out and render a static fallback error page, which you can customise by creating a src/error.html file.

If the error occurs inside a load function in +layout(.server).js, the closest error boundary in the tree is an +error.svelte file above that layout (not next to it).

If no route can be found (404), src/routes/+error.svelte (or the default error page, if that file does not exist) will be used.

+error.svelte is not used when an error occurs inside handle or a +server.js request handler.

You can read more about error handling here.

+layout
So far, we’ve treated pages as entirely standalone components — upon navigation, the existing +page.svelte component will be destroyed, and a new one will take its place.

But in many apps, there are elements that should be visible on every page, such as top-level navigation or a footer. Instead of repeating them in every +page.svelte, we can put them in layouts.

+layout.svelte
To create a layout that applies to every page, make a file called src/routes/+layout.svelte. The default layout (the one that SvelteKit uses if you don’t bring your own) looks like this...


<script>
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

{@render children()}
...but we can add whatever markup, styles and behaviour we want. The only requirement is that the component includes a @render tag for the page content. For example, let’s add a nav bar:

src/routes/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	let { children } = $props();
</script>

<nav>
	<a href="/">Home</a>
	<a href="/about">About</a>
	<a href="/settings">Settings</a>
</nav>

{@render children()}
If we create pages for /, /about and /settings...

src/routes/+page

<h1>Home</h1>
src/routes/about/+page

<h1>About</h1>
src/routes/settings/+page

<h1>Settings</h1>
...the nav will always be visible, and clicking between the three pages will only result in the <h1> being replaced.

Layouts can be nested. Suppose we don’t just have a single /settings page, but instead have nested pages like /settings/profile and /settings/notifications with a shared submenu (for a real-life example, see github.com/settings).

We can create a layout that only applies to pages below /settings (while inheriting the root layout with the top-level nav):

src/routes/settings/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import type { LayoutProps } from './$types';

	let { data, children }: LayoutProps = $props();
</script>

<h1>Settings</h1>

<div class="submenu">
	{#each data.sections as section}
		<a href="/settings/{section.slug}">{section.title}</a>
	{/each}
</div>

{@render children()}
LayoutProps was added in 2.16.0. In earlier versions, you had to type the properties manually instead.

You can see how data is populated by looking at the +layout.js example in the next section just below.

By default, each layout inherits the layout above it. Sometimes that isn’t what you want - in this case, advanced layouts can help you.

+layout.js
Just like +page.svelte loading data from +page.js, your +layout.svelte component can get data from a load function in +layout.js.

src/routes/settings/+layout

import type { LayoutLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutLoad = () => {
	return {
		sections: [
			{ slug: 'profile', title: 'Profile' },
			{ slug: 'notifications', title: 'Notifications' }
		]
	};
};
If a +layout.js exports page options — prerender, ssr and csr — they will be used as defaults for child pages.

Data returned from a layout’s load function is also available to all its child pages:

src/routes/settings/profile/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();

	console.log(data.sections); // [{ slug: 'profile', title: 'Profile' }, ...]
</script>
Often, layout data is unchanged when navigating between pages. SvelteKit will intelligently rerun load functions when necessary.

+layout.server.js
To run your layout’s load function on the server, move it to +layout.server.js, and change the LayoutLoad type to LayoutServerLoad.

Like +layout.js, +layout.server.js can export page options — prerender, ssr and csr.

+server
As well as pages, you can define routes with a +server.js file (sometimes referred to as an ‘API route’ or an ‘endpoint’), which gives you full control over the response. Your +server.js file exports functions corresponding to HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD that take a RequestEvent argument and return a Response object.

For example we could create an /api/random-number route with a GET handler:

src/routes/api/random-number/+server

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const GET: RequestHandler = ({ url }) => {
	const min = Number(url.searchParams.get('min') ?? '0');
	const max = Number(url.searchParams.get('max') ?? '1');

	const d = max - min;

	if (isNaN(d) || d < 0) {
		error(400, 'min and max must be numbers, and min must be less than max');
	}

	const random = min + Math.random() * d;

	return new Response(String(random));
};
The first argument to Response can be a ReadableStream, making it possible to stream large amounts of data or create server-sent events (unless deploying to platforms that buffer responses, like AWS Lambda).

You can use the error, redirect and json methods from @sveltejs/kit for convenience (but you don’t have to).

If an error is thrown (either error(...) or an unexpected error), the response will be a JSON representation of the error or a fallback error page — which can be customised via src/error.html — depending on the Accept header. The +error.svelte component will not be rendered in this case. You can read more about error handling here.

When creating an OPTIONS handler, note that Vite will inject Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Methods headers — these will not be present in production unless you add them.

+layout files have no effect on +server.js files. If you want to run some logic before each request, add it to the server handle hook.

Receiving data
By exporting POST / PUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS/HEAD handlers, +server.js files can be used to create a complete API:

src/routes/add/+page

<script lang="ts">
	let a = $state(0);
	let b = $state(0);
	let total = $state(0);

	async function add() {
		const response = await fetch('/api/add', {
			method: 'POST',
			body: JSON.stringify({ a, b }),
			headers: {
				'content-type': 'application/json'
			}
		});

		total = await response.json();
	}
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={a}> +
<input type="number" bind:value={b}> =
{total}

<button onclick={add}>Calculate</button>
src/routes/api/add/+server

import { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const POST: RequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {
	const { a, b } = await request.json();
	return json(a + b);
};
In general, form actions are a better way to submit data from the browser to the server.

If a GET handler is exported, a HEAD request will return the content-length of the GET handler’s response body.

Fallback method handler
Exporting the fallback handler will match any unhandled request methods, including methods like MOVE which have no dedicated export from +server.js.

src/routes/api/add/+server

import { json, text } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const POST: RequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {
	const { a, b } = await request.json();
	return json(a + b);
};

// This handler will respond to PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.

export const fallback: RequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {
	return text(`I caught your ${request.method} request!`);
};
For HEAD requests, the GET handler takes precedence over the fallback handler.

Content negotiation
+server.js files can be placed in the same directory as +page files, allowing the same route to be either a page or an API endpoint. To determine which, SvelteKit applies the following rules:

PUT / PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS requests are always handled by +server.js since they do not apply to pages
GET / POST/HEAD requests are treated as page requests if the accept header prioritises text/html (in other words, it’s a browser page request), else they are handled by +server.js.
Responses to GET requests will include a Vary: Accept header, so that proxies and browsers cache HTML and JSON responses separately.
$types
Throughout the examples above, we’ve been importing types from a $types.d.ts file. This is a file SvelteKit creates for you in a hidden directory if you’re using TypeScript (or JavaScript with JSDoc type annotations) to give you type safety when working with your root files.

For example, annotating let { data } = $props() with PageProps (or LayoutProps, for a +layout.svelte file) tells TypeScript that the type of data is whatever was returned from load:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();
</script>
The PageProps and LayoutProps types, added in 2.16.0, are a shortcut for typing the data prop as PageData or LayoutData, as well as other props, such as form for pages, or children for layouts. In earlier versions, you had to type these properties manually. For example, for a page:

+page

import type { PageData, ActionData } from './$types';

let { data, form }: { data: PageData, form: ActionData } = $props();
Or, for a layout:

+layout

import type { LayoutData } from './$types';

let { data, children }: { data: LayoutData, children: Snippet } = $props();
In turn, annotating the load function with PageLoad, PageServerLoad, LayoutLoad or LayoutServerLoad (for +page.js, +page.server.js, +layout.js and +layout.server.js respectively) ensures that params and the return value are correctly typed.

If you’re using VS Code or any IDE that supports the language server protocol and TypeScript plugins then you can omit these types entirely! Svelte’s IDE tooling will insert the correct types for you, so you’ll get type checking without writing them yourself. It also works with our command line tool svelte-check.

You can read more about omitting $types in our blog post about it.

Other files
Any other files inside a route directory are ignored by SvelteKit. This means you can colocate components and utility modules with the routes that need them.

If components and modules are needed by multiple routes, it’s a good idea to put them in $lib.

Before a +page.svelte component (and its containing +layout.svelte components) can be rendered, we often need to get some data. This is done by defining load functions.

Page data
A +page.svelte file can have a sibling +page.js that exports a load function, the return value of which is available to the page via the data prop:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = ({ params }) => {
	return {
		post: {
			title: `Title for ${params.slug} goes here`,
			content: `Content for ${params.slug} goes here`
		}
	};
};
src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<h1>{data.post.title}</h1>
<div>{@html data.post.content}</div>
Before version 2.16.0, the props of a page and layout had to be typed individually:

+page

import type { PageData } from './$types';

let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();
In Svelte 4, you’d use export let data instead.

Thanks to the generated $types module, we get full type safety.

A load function in a +page.js file runs both on the server and in the browser (unless combined with export const ssr = false, in which case it will only run in the browser). If your load function should always run on the server (because it uses private environment variables, for example, or accesses a database) then it would go in a +page.server.js instead.

A more realistic version of your blog post’s load function, that only runs on the server and pulls data from a database, might look like this:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ params }) => {
	return {
		post: await db.getPost(params.slug)
	};
};
Notice that the type changed from PageLoad to PageServerLoad, because server load functions can access additional arguments. To understand when to use +page.js and when to use +page.server.js, see Universal vs server.

Layout data
Your +layout.svelte files can also load data, via +layout.js or +layout.server.js.

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async () => {
	return {
		posts: await db.getPostSummaries()
	};
};
src/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import type { LayoutProps } from './$types';

	let { data, children }: LayoutProps = $props();
</script>

<main>
	<!-- +page.svelte is `@render`ed here -->
	{@render children()}
</main>

<aside>
	<h2>More posts</h2>
	<ul>
		{#each data.posts as post}
			<li>
				<a href="/blog/{post.slug}">
					{post.title}
				</a>
			</li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
</aside>
LayoutProps was added in 2.16.0. In earlier versions, properties had to be typed individually:

+layout

import type { LayoutData } from './$types';

let { data, children }: { data: LayoutData, children: Snippet } = $props();
Data returned from layout load functions is available to child +layout.svelte components and the +page.svelte component as well as the layout that it ‘belongs’ to.

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';
	let { data }: PageProps = $props();

	// we can access `data.posts` because it's returned from
	// the parent layout `load` function
	let index = $derived(data.posts.findIndex(post => post.slug === page.params.slug));
	let next = $derived(data.posts[index + 1]);
</script>

<h1>{data.post.title}</h1>
<div>{@html data.post.content}</div>

{#if next}
	<p>Next post: <a href="/blog/{next.slug}">{next.title}</a></p>
{/if}
If multiple load functions return data with the same key, the last one ‘wins’ — the result of a layout load returning { a: 1, b: 2 } and a page load returning { b: 3, c: 4 } would be { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }.

page.data
The +page.svelte component, and each +layout.svelte component above it, has access to its own data plus all the data from its parents.

In some cases, we might need the opposite — a parent layout might need to access page data or data from a child layout. For example, the root layout might want to access a title property returned from a load function in +page.js or +page.server.js. This can be done with page.data:

src/routes/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

<svelte:head>
	<title>{page.data.title}</title>
</svelte:head>
Type information for page.data is provided by App.PageData.

$app/state was added in SvelteKit 2.12. If you’re using an earlier version or are using Svelte 4, use $app/stores instead. It provides a page store with the same interface that you can subscribe to, e.g. $page.data.title.

Universal vs server
As we’ve seen, there are two types of load function:

+page.js and +layout.js files export universal load functions that run both on the server and in the browser
+page.server.js and +layout.server.js files export server load functions that only run server-side
Conceptually, they’re the same thing, but there are some important differences to be aware of.

When does which load function run?
Server load functions always run on the server.

By default, universal load functions run on the server during SSR when the user first visits your page. They will then run again during hydration, reusing any responses from fetch requests. All subsequent invocations of universal load functions happen in the browser. You can customize the behavior through page options. If you disable server-side rendering, you’ll get an SPA and universal load functions always run on the client.

If a route contains both universal and server load functions, the server load runs first.

A load function is invoked at runtime, unless you prerender the page — in that case, it’s invoked at build time.

Input
Both universal and server load functions have access to properties describing the request (params, route and url) and various functions (fetch, setHeaders, parent, depends and untrack). These are described in the following sections.

Server load functions are called with a ServerLoadEvent, which inherits clientAddress, cookies, locals, platform and request from RequestEvent.

Universal load functions are called with a LoadEvent, which has a data property. If you have load functions in both +page.js and +page.server.js (or +layout.js and +layout.server.js), the return value of the server load function is the data property of the universal load function’s argument.

Output
A universal load function can return an object containing any values, including things like custom classes and component constructors.

A server load function must return data that can be serialized with devalue — anything that can be represented as JSON plus things like BigInt, Date, Map, Set and RegExp, or repeated/cyclical references — so that it can be transported over the network. Your data can include promises, in which case it will be streamed to browsers. If you need to serialize/deserialize custom types, use transport hooks.

When to use which
Server load functions are convenient when you need to access data directly from a database or filesystem, or need to use private environment variables.

Universal load functions are useful when you need to fetch data from an external API and don’t need private credentials, since SvelteKit can get the data directly from the API rather than going via your server. They are also useful when you need to return something that can’t be serialized, such as a Svelte component constructor.

In rare cases, you might need to use both together — for example, you might need to return an instance of a custom class that was initialised with data from your server. When using both, the server load return value is not passed directly to the page, but to the universal load function (as the data property):

src/routes/+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async () => {
	return {
		serverMessage: 'hello from server load function'
	};
};
src/routes/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';
export const load: PageLoad = async ({ data }) => {
	return {
		serverMessage: data.serverMessage,
		universalMessage: 'hello from universal load function'
	};
};
Using URL data
Often the load function depends on the URL in one way or another. For this, the load function provides you with url, route and params.

url
An instance of URL, containing properties like the origin, hostname, pathname and searchParams (which contains the parsed query string as a URLSearchParams object). url.hash cannot be accessed during load, since it is unavailable on the server.

In some environments this is derived from request headers during server-side rendering. If you’re using adapter-node, for example, you may need to configure the adapter in order for the URL to be correct.

route
Contains the name of the current route directory, relative to src/routes:

src/routes/a/[b]/[...c]/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = ({ route }) => {
	console.log(route.id); // '/a/[b]/[...c]'
};
params
params is derived from url.pathname and route.id.

Given a route.id of /a/[b]/[...c] and a url.pathname of /a/x/y/z, the params object would look like this:


{
	"b": "x",
	"c": "y/z"
}
Making fetch requests
To get data from an external API or a +server.js handler, you can use the provided fetch function, which behaves identically to the native fetch web API with a few additional features:

It can be used to make credentialed requests on the server, as it inherits the cookie and authorization headers for the page request.
It can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, fetch requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).
Internal requests (e.g. for +server.js routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.
During server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the text, json and arrayBuffer methods of the Response object. Note that headers will not be serialized, unless explicitly included via filterSerializedResponseHeaders.
During hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request - if you received a warning in your browser console when using the browser fetch instead of the load fetch, this is why.
src/routes/items/[id]/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch, params }) => {
	const res = await fetch(`/api/items/${params.id}`);
	const item = await res.json();

	return { item };
};
Cookies
A server load function can get and set cookies.

src/routes/+layout.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
	const sessionid = cookies.get('sessionid');

	return {
		user: await db.getUser(sessionid)
	};
};
Cookies will only be passed through the provided fetch function if the target host is the same as the SvelteKit application or a more specific subdomain of it.

For example, if SvelteKit is serving my.domain.com:

domain.com WILL NOT receive cookies
my.domain.com WILL receive cookies
api.domain.com WILL NOT receive cookies
sub.my.domain.com WILL receive cookies
Other cookies will not be passed when credentials: 'include' is set, because SvelteKit does not know which domain which cookie belongs to (the browser does not pass this information along), so it’s not safe to forward any of them. Use the handleFetch hook to work around it.

Headers
Both server and universal load functions have access to a setHeaders function that, when running on the server, can set headers for the response. (When running in the browser, setHeaders has no effect.) This is useful if you want the page to be cached, for example:

src/routes/products/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';
export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch, setHeaders }) => {
	const url = `https://cms.example.com/products.json`;
	const response = await fetch(url);

	// Headers are only set during SSR, caching the page's HTML
	// for the same length of time as the underlying data.
	setHeaders({
		age: response.headers.get('age'),
		'cache-control': response.headers.get('cache-control')
	});

	return response.json();
};
Setting the same header multiple times (even in separate load functions) is an error. You can only set a given header once using the setHeaders function. You cannot add a set-cookie header with setHeaders — use cookies.set(name, value, options) instead.

Using parent data
Occasionally it’s useful for a load function to access data from a parent load function, which can be done with await parent():

src/routes/+layout

import type { LayoutLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutLoad = () => {
	return { a: 1 };
};
src/routes/abc/+layout

import type { LayoutLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutLoad = async ({ parent }) => {
	const { a } = await parent();
	return { b: a + 1 };
};
src/routes/abc/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ parent }) => {
	const { a, b } = await parent();
	return { c: a + b };
};
src/routes/abc/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<!-- renders `1 + 2 = 3` -->
<p>{data.a} + {data.b} = {data.c}</p>
Notice that the load function in +page.js receives the merged data from both layout load functions, not just the immediate parent.

Inside +page.server.js and +layout.server.js, parent returns data from parent +layout.server.js files.

In +page.js or +layout.js it will return data from parent +layout.js files. However, a missing +layout.js is treated as a ({ data }) => data function, meaning that it will also return data from parent +layout.server.js files that are not ‘shadowed’ by a +layout.js file

Take care not to introduce waterfalls when using await parent(). Here, for example, getData(params) does not depend on the result of calling parent(), so we should call it first to avoid a delayed render.

+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params, parent }) => {
	const parentData = await parent();
	const data = await getData(params);
	const parentData = await parent();

	return {
		...data,
		meta: { ...parentData.meta, ...data.meta }
	};
};
Errors
If an error is thrown during load, the nearest +error.svelte will be rendered. For expected errors, use the error helper from @sveltejs/kit to specify the HTTP status code and an optional message:

src/routes/admin/+layout.server

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = ({ locals }) => {
	if (!locals.user) {
		error(401, 'not logged in');
	}

	if (!locals.user.isAdmin) {
		error(403, 'not an admin');
	}
};
Calling error(...) will throw an exception, making it easy to stop execution from inside helper functions.

If an unexpected error is thrown, SvelteKit will invoke handleError and treat it as a 500 Internal Error.

In SvelteKit 1.x you had to throw the error yourself

Redirects
To redirect users, use the redirect helper from @sveltejs/kit to specify the location to which they should be redirected alongside a 3xx status code. Like error(...), calling redirect(...) will throw an exception, making it easy to stop execution from inside helper functions.

src/routes/user/+layout.server

import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = ({ locals }) => {
	if (!locals.user) {
		redirect(307, '/login');
	}
};
Don’t use redirect() inside a try {...} block, as the redirect will immediately trigger the catch statement.

In the browser, you can also navigate programmatically outside of a load function using goto from $app.navigation.

In SvelteKit 1.x you had to throw the redirect yourself

Streaming with promises
When using a server load, promises will be streamed to the browser as they resolve. This is useful if you have slow, non-essential data, since you can start rendering the page before all the data is available:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ params }) => {
	return {
		// make sure the `await` happens at the end, otherwise we
		// can't start loading comments until we've loaded the post
		comments: loadComments(params.slug),
		post: await loadPost(params.slug)
	};
};
This is useful for creating skeleton loading states, for example:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<h1>{data.post.title}</h1>
<div>{@html data.post.content}</div>

{#await data.comments}
	Loading comments...
{:then comments}
	{#each comments as comment}
		<p>{comment.content}</p>
	{/each}
{:catch error}
	<p>error loading comments: {error.message}</p>
{/await}
When streaming data, be careful to handle promise rejections correctly. More specifically, the server could crash with an “unhandled promise rejection” error if a lazy-loaded promise fails before rendering starts (at which point it’s caught) and isn’t handling the error in some way. When using SvelteKit’s fetch directly in the load function, SvelteKit will handle this case for you. For other promises, it is enough to attach a noop-catch to the promise to mark it as handled.

src/routes/+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = ({ fetch }) => {
	const ok_manual = Promise.reject();
	ok_manual.catch(() => {});

	return {
		ok_manual,
		ok_fetch: fetch('/fetch/that/could/fail'),
		dangerous_unhandled: Promise.reject()
	};
};
On platforms that do not support streaming, such as AWS Lambda or Firebase, responses will be buffered. This means the page will only render once all promises resolve. If you are using a proxy (e.g. NGINX), make sure it does not buffer responses from the proxied server.

Streaming data will only work when JavaScript is enabled. You should avoid returning promises from a universal load function if the page is server rendered, as these are not streamed — instead, the promise is recreated when the function reruns in the browser.

The headers and status code of a response cannot be changed once the response has started streaming, therefore you cannot setHeaders or throw redirects inside a streamed promise.

In SvelteKit 1.x top-level promises were automatically awaited, only nested promises were streamed.

Parallel loading
When rendering (or navigating to) a page, SvelteKit runs all load functions concurrently, avoiding a waterfall of requests. During client-side navigation, the result of calling multiple server load functions are grouped into a single response. Once all load functions have returned, the page is rendered.

Rerunning load functions
SvelteKit tracks the dependencies of each load function to avoid rerunning it unnecessarily during navigation.

For example, given a pair of load functions like these...

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ params }) => {
	return {
		post: await db.getPost(params.slug)
	};
};
src/routes/blog/[slug]/+layout.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async () => {
	return {
		posts: await db.getPostSummaries()
	};
};
...the one in +page.server.js will rerun if we navigate from /blog/trying-the-raw-meat-diet to /blog/i-regret-my-choices because params.slug has changed. The one in +layout.server.js will not, because the data is still valid. In other words, we won’t call db.getPostSummaries() a second time.

A load function that calls await parent() will also rerun if a parent load function is rerun.

Dependency tracking does not apply after the load function has returned — for example, accessing params.x inside a nested promise will not cause the function to rerun when params.x changes. (Don’t worry, you’ll get a warning in development if you accidentally do this.) Instead, access the parameter in the main body of your load function.

Search parameters are tracked independently from the rest of the url. For example, accessing event.url.searchParams.get("x") inside a load function will make that load function re-run when navigating from ?x=1 to ?x=2, but not when navigating from ?x=1&y=1 to ?x=1&y=2.

Untracking dependencies
In rare cases, you may wish to exclude something from the dependency tracking mechanism. You can do this with the provided untrack function:

src/routes/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ untrack, url }) => {
	// Untrack url.pathname so that path changes don't trigger a rerun
	if (untrack(() => url.pathname === '/')) {
		return { message: 'Welcome!' };
	}
};
Manual invalidation
You can also rerun load functions that apply to the current page using invalidate(url), which reruns all load functions that depend on url, and invalidateAll(), which reruns every load function. Server load functions will never automatically depend on a fetched url to avoid leaking secrets to the client.

A load function depends on url if it calls fetch(url) or depends(url). Note that url can be a custom identifier that starts with [a-z]::

src/routes/random-number/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch, depends }) => {
	// load reruns when `invalidate('https://api.example.com/random-number')` is called...
	const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/random-number');

	// ...or when `invalidate('app:random')` is called
	depends('app:random');

	return {
		number: await response.json()
	};
};
src/routes/random-number/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { invalidate, invalidateAll } from '$app/navigation';
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';
	let { data }: PageProps = $props();

	function rerunLoadFunction() {
		// any of these will cause the `load` function to rerun
		invalidate('app:random');
		invalidate('https://api.example.com/random-number');
		invalidate(url => url.href.includes('random-number'));
		invalidateAll();
	}
</script>

<p>random number: {data.number}</p>
<button onclick={rerunLoadFunction}>Update random number</button>
When do load functions rerun?
To summarize, a load function will rerun in the following situations:

It references a property of params whose value has changed
It references a property of url (such as url.pathname or url.search) whose value has changed. Properties in request.url are not tracked
It calls url.searchParams.get(...), url.searchParams.getAll(...) or url.searchParams.has(...) and the parameter in question changes. Accessing other properties of url.searchParams will have the same effect as accessing url.search.
It calls await parent() and a parent load function reran
A child load function calls await parent() and is rerunning, and the parent is a server load function
It declared a dependency on a specific URL via fetch (universal load only) or depends, and that URL was marked invalid with invalidate(url)
All active load functions were forcibly rerun with invalidateAll()
params and url can change in response to a <a href=".."> link click, a <form> interaction, a goto invocation, or a redirect.

Note that rerunning a load function will update the data prop inside the corresponding +layout.svelte or +page.svelte; it does not cause the component to be recreated. As a result, internal state is preserved. If this isn’t what you want, you can reset whatever you need to reset inside an afterNavigate callback, and/or wrap your component in a {#key ...} block.

Implications for authentication
A couple features of loading data have important implications for auth checks:

Layout load functions do not run on every request, such as during client side navigation between child routes. (When do load functions rerun?)
Layout and page load functions run concurrently unless await parent() is called. If a layout load throws, the page load function runs, but the client will not receive the returned data.
There are a few possible strategies to ensure an auth check occurs before protected code.

To prevent data waterfalls and preserve layout load caches:

Use hooks to protect multiple routes before any load functions run
Use auth guards directly in +page.server.js load functions for route specific protection
Putting an auth guard in +layout.server.js requires all child pages to call await parent() before protected code. Unless every child page depends on returned data from await parent(), the other options will be more performant.

Using getRequestEvent
When running server load functions, the event object passed to the function as an argument can also be retrieved with getRequestEvent. This allows shared logic (such as authentication guards) to access information about the current request without it needing to be passed around.

For example, you might have a function that requires users to be logged in, and redirects them to /login if not:

src/lib/server/auth

import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { getRequestEvent } from '$app/server';

export function requireLogin() {
	const { locals, url } = getRequestEvent();

	// assume `locals.user` is populated in `handle`
	if (!locals.user) {
		const redirectTo = url.pathname + url.search;
		const params = new URLSearchParams({ redirectTo });

		redirect(307, `/login?${params}`);
	}

	return locals.user;
}
Now, you can call requireLogin in any load function (or form action, for example) to guarantee that the user is logged in:

+page.server

import { requireLogin } from '$lib/server/auth';

export function load() {
	const user = requireLogin();

	// `user` is guaranteed to be a user object here, because otherwise
	// `requireLogin` would throw a redirect and we wouldn't get here
	return {
		message: `hello ${user.name}!`
	};
}

GET vs POST
Further reading
A +page.server.js file can export actions, which allow you to POST data to the server using the <form> element.

When using <form>, client-side JavaScript is optional, but you can easily progressively enhance your form interactions with JavaScript to provide the best user experience.

Default actions
In the simplest case, a page declares a default action:

src/routes/login/+page.server

import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions = {
	default: async (event) => {
		// TODO log the user in
	}
} satisfies Actions;
To invoke this action from the /login page, just add a <form> — no JavaScript needed:

src/routes/login/+page

<form method="POST">
	<label>
		Email
		<input name="email" type="email">
	</label>
	<label>
		Password
		<input name="password" type="password">
	</label>
	<button>Log in</button>
</form>
If someone were to click the button, the browser would send the form data via POST request to the server, running the default action.

Actions always use POST requests, since GET requests should never have side-effects.

We can also invoke the action from other pages (for example if there’s a login widget in the nav in the root layout) by adding the action attribute, pointing to the page:

src/routes/+layout

<form method="POST" action="/login">
	<!-- content -->
</form>
Named actions
Instead of one default action, a page can have as many named actions as it needs:

src/routes/login/+page.server

import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions = {
	default: async (event) => {
	login: async (event) => {
		// TODO log the user in
	},
	register: async (event) => {
		// TODO register the user
	}
} satisfies Actions;
To invoke a named action, add a query parameter with the name prefixed by a / character:

src/routes/login/+page

<form method="POST" action="?/register">
src/routes/+layout

<form method="POST" action="/login?/register">
As well as the action attribute, we can use the formaction attribute on a button to POST the same form data to a different action than the parent <form>:

src/routes/login/+page

<form method="POST" action="?/login">
	<label>
		Email
		<input name="email" type="email">
	</label>
	<label>
		Password
		<input name="password" type="password">
	</label>
	<button>Log in</button>
	<button formaction="?/register">Register</button>
</form>
We can’t have default actions next to named actions, because if you POST to a named action without a redirect, the query parameter is persisted in the URL, which means the next default POST would go through the named action from before.

Anatomy of an action
Each action receives a RequestEvent object, allowing you to read the data with request.formData(). After processing the request (for example, logging the user in by setting a cookie), the action can respond with data that will be available through the form property on the corresponding page and through page.form app-wide until the next update.

src/routes/login/+page.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/db';
import type { PageServerLoad, Actions } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ cookies }) => {
	const user = await db.getUserFromSession(cookies.get('sessionid'));
	return { user };
};

export const actions = {
	login: async ({ cookies, request }) => {
		const data = await request.formData();
		const email = data.get('email');
		const password = data.get('password');

		const user = await db.getUser(email);
		cookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user), { path: '/' });

		return { success: true };
	},
	register: async (event) => {
		// TODO register the user
	}
} satisfies Actions;
src/routes/login/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data, form }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

{#if form?.success}
	<!-- this message is ephemeral; it exists because the page was rendered in
	       response to a form submission. it will vanish if the user reloads -->
	<p>Successfully logged in! Welcome back, {data.user.name}</p>
{/if}
PageProps was added in 2.16.0. In earlier versions, you had to type the data and form properties individually:

+page

import type { PageData, ActionData } from './$types';

let { data, form }: { data: PageData, form: ActionData } = $props();
In Svelte 4, you’d use export let data and export let form instead to declare properties.

Validation errors
If the request couldn’t be processed because of invalid data, you can return validation errors — along with the previously submitted form values — back to the user so that they can try again. The fail function lets you return an HTTP status code (typically 400 or 422, in the case of validation errors) along with the data. The status code is available through page.status and the data through form:

src/routes/login/+page.server

import { fail } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import * as db from '$lib/server/db';
import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions = {
	login: async ({ cookies, request }) => {
		const data = await request.formData();
		const email = data.get('email');
		const password = data.get('password');

		if (!email) {
			return fail(400, { email, missing: true });
		}

		const user = await db.getUser(email);

		if (!user || user.password !== db.hash(password)) {
			return fail(400, { email, incorrect: true });
		}

		cookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user), { path: '/' });

		return { success: true };
	},
	register: async (event) => {
		// TODO register the user
	}
} satisfies Actions;
Note that as a precaution, we only return the email back to the page — not the password.

src/routes/login/+page

<form method="POST" action="?/login">
	{#if form?.missing}<p class="error">The email field is required</p>{/if}
	{#if form?.incorrect}<p class="error">Invalid credentials!</p>{/if}
	<label>
		Email
		<input name="email" type="email" value={form?.email ?? ''}>
	</label>
	<label>
		Password
		<input name="password" type="password">
	</label>
	<button>Log in</button>
	<button formaction="?/register">Register</button>
</form>
The returned data must be serializable as JSON. Beyond that, the structure is entirely up to you. For example, if you had multiple forms on the page, you could distinguish which <form> the returned form data referred to with an id property or similar.

Redirects
Redirects (and errors) work exactly the same as in load:

src/routes/login/+page.server

import { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import * as db from '$lib/server/db';
import type { Actions } from './$types';

export const actions = {
	login: async ({ cookies, request, url }) => {
		const data = await request.formData();
		const email = data.get('email');
		const password = data.get('password');

		const user = await db.getUser(email);
		if (!user) {
			return fail(400, { email, missing: true });
		}

		if (user.password !== db.hash(password)) {
			return fail(400, { email, incorrect: true });
		}

		cookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user), { path: '/' });

		if (url.searchParams.has('redirectTo')) {
			redirect(303, url.searchParams.get('redirectTo'));
		}

		return { success: true };
	},
	register: async (event) => {
		// TODO register the user
	}
} satisfies Actions;
Loading data
After an action runs, the page will be re-rendered (unless a redirect or an unexpected error occurs), with the action’s return value available to the page as the form prop. This means that your page’s load functions will run after the action completes.

Note that handle runs before the action is invoked, and does not rerun before the load functions. This means that if, for example, you use handle to populate event.locals based on a cookie, you must update event.locals when you set or delete the cookie in an action:

src/hooks.server

import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	event.locals.user = await getUser(event.cookies.get('sessionid'));
	return resolve(event);
};
src/routes/account/+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad, Actions } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = (event) => {
	return {
		user: event.locals.user
	};
};

export const actions = {
	logout: async (event) => {
		event.cookies.delete('sessionid', { path: '/' });
		event.locals.user = null;
	}
} satisfies Actions;
Progressive enhancement
In the preceding sections we built a /login action that works without client-side JavaScript — not a fetch in sight. That’s great, but when JavaScript is available we can progressively enhance our form interactions to provide a better user experience.

use:enhance
The easiest way to progressively enhance a form is to add the use:enhance action:

src/routes/login/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance } from '$app/forms';
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';
	let { form }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<form method="POST" use:enhance>
use:enhance can only be used with forms that have method="POST" and point to actions defined in a +page.server.js file. It will not work with method="GET", which is the default for forms without a specified method. Attempting to use use:enhance on forms without method="POST" or posting to a +server.js endpoint will result in an error.

Yes, it’s a little confusing that the enhance action and <form action> are both called ‘action’. These docs are action-packed. Sorry.

Without an argument, use:enhance will emulate the browser-native behaviour, just without the full-page reloads. It will:

update the form property, page.form and page.status on a successful or invalid response, but only if the action is on the same page you’re submitting from. For example, if your form looks like <form action="/somewhere/else" ..>, the form prop and the page.form state will not be updated. This is because in the native form submission case you would be redirected to the page the action is on. If you want to have them updated either way, use applyAction
reset the <form> element
invalidate all data using invalidateAll on a successful response
call goto on a redirect response
render the nearest +error boundary if an error occurs
reset focus to the appropriate element
Customising use:enhance
To customise the behaviour, you can provide a SubmitFunction that runs immediately before the form is submitted, and (optionally) returns a callback that runs with the ActionResult.


<form
	method="POST"
	use:enhance={({ formElement, formData, action, cancel, submitter }) => {
		// `formElement` is this `<form>` element
		// `formData` is its `FormData` object that's about to be submitted
		// `action` is the URL to which the form is posted
		// calling `cancel()` will prevent the submission
		// `submitter` is the `HTMLElement` that caused the form to be submitted

		return async ({ result, update }) => {
			// `result` is an `ActionResult` object
			// `update` is a function which triggers the default logic that would be triggered if this callback wasn't set
		};
	}}
>
You can use these functions to show and hide loading UI, and so on.

If you return a callback, you override the default post-submission behavior. To get it back, call update, which accepts invalidateAll and reset parameters, or use applyAction on the result:

src/routes/login/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { enhance, applyAction } from '$app/forms';
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';
	let { form }: PageProps = $props();
</script>

<form
	method="POST"
	use:enhance={({ formElement, formData, action, cancel }) => {
		return async ({ result }) => {
			// `result` is an `ActionResult` object
			if (result.type === 'redirect') {
				goto(result.location);
			} else {
				await applyAction(result);
			}
		};
	}}
>
The behaviour of applyAction(result) depends on result.type:

success, failure — sets page.status to result.status and updates form and page.form to result.data (regardless of where you are submitting from, in contrast to update from enhance)
redirect — calls goto(result.location, { invalidateAll: true })
error — renders the nearest +error boundary with result.error
In all cases, focus will be reset.

Custom event listener
We can also implement progressive enhancement ourselves, without use:enhance, with a normal event listener on the <form>:

src/routes/login/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { invalidateAll, goto } from '$app/navigation';
	import { applyAction, deserialize } from '$app/forms';
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';
	import type { ActionResult } from '@sveltejs/kit';
	let { form }: PageProps = $props();

	async function handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent & { currentTarget: EventTarget & HTMLFormElement}) {
		event.preventDefault();
		const data = new FormData(event.currentTarget, event.submitter);

		const response = await fetch(event.currentTarget.action, {
			method: 'POST',
			body: data
		});

		const result: ActionResult = deserialize(await response.text());

		if (result.type === 'success') {
			// rerun all `load` functions, following the successful update
			await invalidateAll();
		}

		applyAction(result);
	}
</script>

<form method="POST" onsubmit={handleSubmit}>
	<!-- content -->
</form>
Note that you need to deserialize the response before processing it further using the corresponding method from $app/forms. JSON.parse() isn’t enough because form actions - like load functions - also support returning Date or BigInt objects.

If you have a +server.js alongside your +page.server.js, fetch requests will be routed there by default. To POST to an action in +page.server.js instead, use the custom x-sveltekit-action header:


const response = await fetch(this.action, {
	method: 'POST',
	body: data,
	headers: {
		'x-sveltekit-action': 'true'
	}
});
Alternatives
Form actions are the preferred way to send data to the server, since they can be progressively enhanced, but you can also use +server.js files to expose (for example) a JSON API. Here’s how such an interaction could look like:

src/routes/send-message/+page

<script lang="ts">
	function rerun() {
		fetch('/api/ci', {
			method: 'POST'
		});
	}
</script>

<button onclick={rerun}>Rerun CI</button>
src/routes/api/ci/+server

import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';
export const POST: RequestHandler = () => {
	// do something
};
GET vs POST
As we’ve seen, to invoke a form action you must use method="POST".

Some forms don’t need to POST data to the server — search inputs, for example. For these you can use method="GET" (or, equivalently, no method at all), and SvelteKit will treat them like <a> elements, using the client-side router instead of a full page navigation:


<form action="/search">
	<label>
		Search
		<input name="q">
	</label>
</form>
Submitting this form will navigate to /search?q=... and invoke your load function but will not invoke an action. As with <a> elements, you can set the data-sveltekit-reload, data-sveltekit-replacestate, data-sveltekit-keepfocus and data-sveltekit-noscroll attributes on the <form> to control the router’s behaviour.

By default, SvelteKit will render (or prerender) any component first on the server and send it to the client as HTML. It will then render the component again in the browser to make it interactive in a process called hydration. For this reason, you need to ensure that components can run in both places. SvelteKit will then initialize a router that takes over subsequent navigations.

You can control each of these on a page-by-page basis by exporting options from +page.js or +page.server.js, or for groups of pages using a shared +layout.js or +layout.server.js. To define an option for the whole app, export it from the root layout. Child layouts and pages override values set in parent layouts, so — for example — you can enable prerendering for your entire app then disable it for pages that need to be dynamically rendered.

You can mix and match these options in different areas of your app. For example, you could prerender your marketing page for maximum speed, server-render your dynamic pages for SEO and accessibility and turn your admin section into an SPA by rendering it on the client only. This makes SvelteKit very versatile.

prerender
It’s likely that at least some routes of your app can be represented as a simple HTML file generated at build time. These routes can be prerendered.

+page.js/+page.server.js/+server

export const prerender = true;
Alternatively, you can set export const prerender = true in your root +layout.js or +layout.server.js and prerender everything except pages that are explicitly marked as not prerenderable:

+page.js/+page.server.js/+server

export const prerender = false;
Routes with prerender = true will be excluded from manifests used for dynamic SSR, making your server (or serverless/edge functions) smaller. In some cases you might want to prerender a route but also include it in the manifest (for example, with a route like /blog/[slug] where you want to prerender your most recent/popular content but server-render the long tail) — for these cases, there’s a third option, ‘auto’:

+page.js/+page.server.js/+server

export const prerender = 'auto';
If your entire app is suitable for prerendering, you can use adapter-static, which will output files suitable for use with any static webserver.

The prerenderer will start at the root of your app and generate files for any prerenderable pages or +server.js routes it finds. Each page is scanned for <a> elements that point to other pages that are candidates for prerendering — because of this, you generally don’t need to specify which pages should be accessed. If you do need to specify which pages should be accessed by the prerenderer, you can do so with config.kit.prerender.entries, or by exporting an entries function from your dynamic route.

While prerendering, the value of building imported from $app/environment will be true.

Prerendering server routes
Unlike the other page options, prerender also applies to +server.js files. These files are not affected by layouts, but will inherit default values from the pages that fetch data from them, if any. For example if a +page.js contains this load function...

+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';
export const prerender = true;

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const res = await fetch('/my-server-route.json');
	return await res.json();
};
...then src/routes/my-server-route.json/+server.js will be treated as prerenderable if it doesn’t contain its own export const prerender = false.

When not to prerender
The basic rule is this: for a page to be prerenderable, any two users hitting it directly must get the same content from the server.

Not all pages are suitable for prerendering. Any content that is prerendered will be seen by all users. You can of course fetch personalized data in onMount in a prerendered page, but this may result in a poorer user experience since it will involve blank initial content or loading indicators.

Note that you can still prerender pages that load data based on the page’s parameters, such as a src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte route.

Accessing url.searchParams during prerendering is forbidden. If you need to use it, ensure you are only doing so in the browser (for example in onMount).

Pages with actions cannot be prerendered, because a server must be able to handle the action POST requests.

Route conflicts
Because prerendering writes to the filesystem, it isn’t possible to have two endpoints that would cause a directory and a file to have the same name. For example, src/routes/foo/+server.js and src/routes/foo/bar/+server.js would try to create foo and foo/bar, which is impossible.

For that reason among others, it’s recommended that you always include a file extension — src/routes/foo.json/+server.js and src/routes/foo/bar.json/+server.js would result in foo.json and foo/bar.json files living harmoniously side-by-side.

For pages, we skirt around this problem by writing foo/index.html instead of foo.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter an error like ‘The following routes were marked as prerenderable, but were not prerendered’ it’s because the route in question (or a parent layout, if it’s a page) has export const prerender = true but the page wasn’t reached by the prerendering crawler and thus wasn’t prerendered.

Since these routes cannot be dynamically server-rendered, this will cause errors when people try to access the route in question. There are a few ways to fix it:

Ensure that SvelteKit can find the route by following links from config.kit.prerender.entries or the entries page option. Add links to dynamic routes (i.e. pages with [parameters] ) to this option if they are not found through crawling the other entry points, else they are not prerendered because SvelteKit doesn’t know what value the parameters should have. Pages not marked as prerenderable will be ignored and their links to other pages will not be crawled, even if some of them would be prerenderable.
Ensure that SvelteKit can find the route by discovering a link to it from one of your other prerendered pages that have server-side rendering enabled.
Change export const prerender = true to export const prerender = 'auto'. Routes with 'auto' can be dynamically server rendered
entries
SvelteKit will discover pages to prerender automatically, by starting at entry points and crawling them. By default, all your non-dynamic routes are considered entry points — for example, if you have these routes...


/    # non-dynamic
/blog# non-dynamic
/blog/[slug]  # dynamic, because of `[slug]`
...SvelteKit will prerender / and /blog, and in the process discover links like <a href="/blog/hello-world"> which give it new pages to prerender.

Most of the time, that’s enough. In some situations, links to pages like /blog/hello-world might not exist (or might not exist on prerendered pages), in which case we need to tell SvelteKit about their existence.

This can be done with config.kit.prerender.entries, or by exporting an entries function from a +page.js, a +page.server.js or a +server.js belonging to a dynamic route:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import type { EntryGenerator } from './$types';

export const entries: EntryGenerator = () => {
	return [
		{ slug: 'hello-world' },
		{ slug: 'another-blog-post' }
	];
};

export const prerender = true;
entries can be an async function, allowing you to (for example) retrieve a list of posts from a CMS or database, in the example above.

ssr
Normally, SvelteKit renders your page on the server first and sends that HTML to the client where it’s hydrated. If you set ssr to false, it renders an empty ‘shell’ page instead. This is useful if your page is unable to be rendered on the server (because you use browser-only globals like document for example), but in most situations it’s not recommended (see appendix).

+page

export const ssr = false;
// If both `ssr` and `csr` are `false`, nothing will be rendered!
If you add export const ssr = false to your root +layout.js, your entire app will only be rendered on the client — which essentially means you turn your app into an SPA.

If all your page options are boolean or string literal values, SvelteKit will evaluate them statically. If not, it will import your +page.js or +layout.js file on the server (both at build time, and at runtime if your app isn’t fully static) so it can evaluate the options. In the second case, browser-only code must not run when the module is loaded. In practice, this means you should import browser-only code in your +page.svelte or +layout.svelte file instead.

csr
Ordinarily, SvelteKit hydrates your server-rendered HTML into an interactive client-side-rendered (CSR) page. Some pages don’t require JavaScript at all — many blog posts and ‘about’ pages fall into this category. In these cases you can disable CSR:

+page

export const csr = false;
// If both `csr` and `ssr` are `false`, nothing will be rendered!
Disabling CSR does not ship any JavaScript to the client. This means:

The webpage should work with HTML and CSS only.
<script> tags inside all Svelte components are removed.
<form> elements cannot be progressively enhanced.
Links are handled by the browser with a full-page navigation.
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) will be disabled.
You can enable csr during development (for example to take advantage of HMR) like so:

+page

import { dev } from '$app/environment';

export const csr = dev;
trailingSlash
By default, SvelteKit will remove trailing slashes from URLs — if you visit /about/, it will respond with a redirect to /about. You can change this behaviour with the trailingSlash option, which can be one of 'never' (the default), 'always', or 'ignore'.

As with other page options, you can export this value from a +layout.js or a +layout.server.js and it will apply to all child pages. You can also export the configuration from +server.js files.

src/routes/+layout

export const trailingSlash = 'always';
This option also affects prerendering. If trailingSlash is always, a route like /about will result in an about/index.html file, otherwise it will create about.html, mirroring static webserver conventions.

Ignoring trailing slashes is not recommended — the semantics of relative paths differ between the two cases (./y from /x is /y, but from /x/ is /x/y), and /x and /x/ are treated as separate URLs which is harmful to SEO.

config
With the concept of adapters, SvelteKit is able to run on a variety of platforms. Each of these might have specific configuration to further tweak the deployment — for example on Vercel you could choose to deploy some parts of your app on the edge and others on serverless environments.

config is an object with key-value pairs at the top level. Beyond that, the concrete shape is dependent on the adapter you’re using. Every adapter should provide a Config interface to import for type safety. Consult the documentation of your adapter for more information.

src/routes/+page

import type { Config } from 'some-adapter';

export const config: Config = {
	runtime: 'edge'
};
config objects are merged at the top level (but not deeper levels). This means you don’t need to repeat all the values in a +page.js if you want to only override some of the values in the upper +layout.js. For example this layout configuration...

src/routes/+layout

export const config = {
	runtime: 'edge',
	regions: 'all',
	foo: {
		bar: true
	}
}
...is overridden by this page configuration...

src/routes/+page

export const config = {
	regions: ['us1', 'us2'],
	foo: {
		baz: true
	}
}
...which results in the config value { runtime: 'edge', regions: ['us1', 'us2'], foo: { baz: true } } for that page.

State management

State management
Avoid shared state on the server
No side-effects in load
Using state and stores with context
Component and page state is preserved
Storing state in the URL
Storing ephemeral state in snapshots
If you’re used to building client-only apps, state management in an app that spans server and client might seem intimidating. This section provides tips for avoiding some common gotchas.

Avoid shared state on the server
Browsers are stateful — state is stored in memory as the user interacts with the application. Servers, on the other hand, are stateless — the content of the response is determined entirely by the content of the request.

Conceptually, that is. In reality, servers are often long-lived and shared by multiple users. For that reason it’s important not to store data in shared variables. For example, consider this code:

+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad, Actions } from './$types';
let user;

export const load: PageServerLoad = () => {
	return { user };
};

export const actions = {
	default: async ({ request }) => {
		const data = await request.formData();

		// NEVER DO THIS!
		user = {
			name: data.get('name'),
			embarrassingSecret: data.get('secret')
		};
	}
} satisfies Actions
The user variable is shared by everyone who connects to this server. If Alice submitted an embarrassing secret, and Bob visited the page after her, Bob would know Alice’s secret. In addition, when Alice returns to the site later in the day, the server may have restarted, losing her data.

Instead, you should authenticate the user using cookies and persist the data to a database.

No side-effects in load
For the same reason, your load functions should be pure — no side-effects (except maybe the occasional console.log(...)). For example, you might be tempted to write to a store or global state inside a load function so that you can use the value in your components:

+page

import { user } from '$lib/user';
import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const response = await fetch('/api/user');

	// NEVER DO THIS!
	user.set(await response.json());
};
As with the previous example, this puts one user’s information in a place that is shared by all users. Instead, just return the data...

+page

import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ fetch }) => {
	const response = await fetch('/api/user');

	return {
		user: await response.json()
	};
};
...and pass it around to the components that need it, or use page.data.

If you’re not using SSR, then there’s no risk of accidentally exposing one user’s data to another. But you should still avoid side-effects in your load functions — your application will be much easier to reason about without them.

Using state and stores with context
You might wonder how we’re able to use page.data and other app state (or app stores) if we can’t use global state. The answer is that app state and app stores on the server use Svelte’s context API — the state (or store) is attached to the component tree with setContext, and when you subscribe you retrieve it with getContext. We can do the same thing with our own state:

src/routes/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import { setContext } from 'svelte';
	import type { LayoutProps } from './$types';
	let { data }: LayoutProps = $props();

	// Pass a function referencing our state
	// to the context for child components to access
	setContext('user', () => data.user);
</script>
src/routes/user/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getContext } from 'svelte';

	// Retrieve user store from context
	const user = getContext('user');
</script>

<p>Welcome {user().name}</p>
We’re passing a function into setContext to keep reactivity across boundaries. Read more about it here

You also use stores from svelte/store for this, but when using Svelte 5 it is recommended to make use of universal reactivity instead.

Updating the value of context-based state in deeper-level pages or components while the page is being rendered via SSR will not affect the value in the parent component because it has already been rendered by the time the state value is updated. In contrast, on the client (when CSR is enabled, which is the default) the value will be propagated and components, pages, and layouts higher in the hierarchy will react to the new value. Therefore, to avoid values ‘flashing’ during state updates during hydration, it is generally recommended to pass state down into components rather than up.

If you’re not using SSR (and can guarantee that you won’t need to use SSR in future) then you can safely keep state in a shared module, without using the context API.

Component and page state is preserved
When you navigate around your application, SvelteKit reuses existing layout and page components. For example, if you have a route like this...

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();

	// THIS CODE IS BUGGY!
	const wordCount = data.content.split(' ').length;
	const estimatedReadingTime = wordCount / 250;
</script>

<header>
	<h1>{data.title}</h1>
	<p>Reading time: {Math.round(estimatedReadingTime)} minutes</p>
</header>

<div>{@html data.content}</div>
...then navigating from /blog/my-short-post to /blog/my-long-post won’t cause the layout, page and any other components within to be destroyed and recreated. Instead the data prop (and by extension data.title and data.content) will update (as it would with any other Svelte component) and, because the code isn’t rerunning, lifecycle methods like onMount and onDestroy won’t rerun and estimatedReadingTime won’t be recalculated.

Instead, we need to make the value reactive:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: PageProps = $props();

	let wordCount = $derived(data.content.split(' ').length);
	let estimatedReadingTime = $derived(wordCount / 250);
</script>
If your code in onMount and onDestroy has to run again after navigation you can use afterNavigate and beforeNavigate respectively.

Reusing components like this means that things like sidebar scroll state are preserved, and you can easily animate between changing values. In the case that you do need to completely destroy and remount a component on navigation, you can use this pattern:


<script>
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

{#key page.url.pathname}
	<BlogPost title={data.title} content={data.title} />
{/key}
Storing state in the URL
If you have state that should survive a reload and/or affect SSR, such as filters or sorting rules on a table, URL search parameters (like ?sort=price&order=ascending) are a good place to put them. You can put them in <a href="..."> or <form action="..."> attributes, or set them programmatically via goto('?key=value'). They can be accessed inside load functions via the url parameter, and inside components via page.url.searchParams.

Storing ephemeral state in snapshots
Some UI state, such as ‘is the accordion open?’, is disposable — if the user navigates away or refreshes the page, it doesn’t matter if the state is lost. In some cases, you do want the data to persist if the user navigates to a different page and comes back, but storing the state in the URL or in a database would be overkill. For this, SvelteKit provides snapshots, which let you associate component state with a history entry.

Available since 2.27

Remote functions are a tool for type-safe communication between client and server. They can be called anywhere in your app, but always run on the server, meaning they can safely access server-only modules containing things like environment variables and database clients.

Combined with Svelte’s experimental support for await, it allows you to load and manipulate data directly inside your components.

This feature is currently experimental, meaning it is likely to contain bugs and is subject to change without notice. You must opt in by adding the kit.experimental.remoteFunctions option in your svelte.config.js and optionally, the compilerOptions.experimental.async option to use await in components:

svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		experimental: {
			remoteFunctions: true
		}
	},
	compilerOptions: {
		experimental: {
			async: true
		}
	}
};

export default config;
Overview
Remote functions are exported from a .remote.js or .remote.ts file, and come in four flavours: query, form, command and prerender. On the client, the exported functions are transformed to fetch wrappers that invoke their counterparts on the server via a generated HTTP endpoint. Remote files can be placed anywhere in your src directory (except inside the src/lib/server directory), and third party libraries can provide them, too.

query
The query function allows you to read dynamic data from the server (for static data, consider using prerender instead):

src/routes/blog/data.remote

import { query } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getPosts = query(async () => {
	const posts = await db.sql`
		SELECT title, slug
		FROM post
		ORDER BY published_at
		DESC
	`;

	return posts;
});
Throughout this page, you’ll see imports from fictional modules like $lib/server/database and $lib/server/auth. These are purely for illustrative purposes — you can use whatever database client and auth setup you like.

The db.sql function above is a tagged template function that escapes any interpolated values.

The query returned from getPosts works as a Promise that resolves to posts:

src/routes/blog/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getPosts } from './data.remote';
</script>

<h1>Recent posts</h1>

<ul>
	{#each await getPosts() as { title, slug }}
		<li><a href="/blog/{slug}">{title}</a></li>
	{/each}
</ul>
Until the promise resolves — and if it errors — the nearest <svelte:boundary> will be invoked.

While using await is recommended, as an alternative the query also has loading, error and current properties:

src/routes/blog/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getPosts } from './data.remote';

	const query = getPosts();
</script>

<h1>Recent posts</h1>

{#if query.error}
	<p>oops!</p>
{:else if query.loading}
	<p>loading...</p>
{:else}
	<ul>
		{#each query.current as { title, slug }}
			<li><a href="/blog/{slug}">{title}</a></li>
		{/each}
	</ul>
{/if}
For the rest of this document, we’ll use the await form.

Query arguments
Query functions can accept an argument, such as the slug of an individual post:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getPost } from '../data.remote';

	let { params } = $props();

	const post = $derived(await getPost(params.slug));
</script>

<h1>{post.title}</h1>
<div>{@html post.content}</div>
Since getPost exposes an HTTP endpoint, it’s important to validate this argument to be sure that it’s the correct type. For this, we can use any Standard Schema validation library such as Zod or Valibot:

src/routes/blog/data.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { query } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getPosts = query(async () => { /* ... */ });

export const getPost = query(v.string(), async (slug) => {
	const [post] = await db.sql`
		SELECT * FROM post
		WHERE slug = ${slug}
	`;

	if (!post) error(404, 'Not found');
	return post;
});
Both the argument and the return value are serialized with devalue, which handles types like Date and Map (and custom types defined in your transport hook) in addition to JSON.

Refreshing queries
Any query can be re-fetched via its refresh method, which retrieves the latest value from the server:


<button onclick={() => getPosts().refresh()}>
	Check for new posts
</button>
Queries are cached while they’re on the page, meaning getPosts() === getPosts(). This means you don’t need a reference like const posts = getPosts() in order to update the query.

query.batch
query.batch works like query except that it batches requests that happen within the same macrotask. This solves the so-called n+1 problem: rather than each query resulting in a separate database call (for example), simultaneous queries are grouped together.

On the server, the callback receives an array of the arguments the function was called with. It must return a function of the form (input: Input, index: number) => Output. SvelteKit will then call this with each of the input arguments to resolve the individual calls with their results.

weather.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { query } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getWeather = query.batch(v.string(), async (cities) => {
	const weather = await db.sql`
		SELECT * FROM weather
		WHERE city = ANY(${cities})
	`;
	const lookup = new Map(weather.map(w => [w.city, w]));

	return (city) => lookup.get(city);
});
Weather

<script lang="ts">
	import CityWeather from './CityWeather.svelte';
	import { getWeather } from './weather.remote.js';

	let { cities } = $props();
	let limit = $state(5);
</script>

<h2>Weather</h2>

{#each cities.slice(0, limit) as city}
	<h3>{city.name}</h3>
	<CityWeather weather={await getWeather(city.id)} />
{/each}

{#if cities.length > limit}
	<button onclick={() => limit += 5}>
		Load more
	</button>
{/if}
form
The form function makes it easy to write data to the server. It takes a callback that receives data constructed from the submitted FormData...

src/routes/blog/data.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { error, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { query, form } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import * as auth from '$lib/server/auth';

export const getPosts = query(async () => { /* ... */ });

export const getPost = query(v.string(), async (slug) => { /* ... */ });

export const createPost = form(
	v.object({
		title: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty()),
		content:v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty())
	}),
	async ({ title, content }) => {
		// Check the user is logged in
		const user = await auth.getUser();
		if (!user) error(401, 'Unauthorized');

		const slug = title.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-');

		// Insert into the database
		await db.sql`
			INSERT INTO post (slug, title, content)
			VALUES (${slug}, ${title}, ${content})
		`;

		// Redirect to the newly created page
		redirect(303, `/blog/${slug}`);
	}
);
...and returns an object that can be spread onto a <form> element. The callback is called whenever the form is submitted.

src/routes/blog/new/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { createPost } from '../data.remote';
</script>

<h1>Create a new post</h1>

<form {...createPost}>
	<!-- form content goes here -->

	<button>Publish!</button>
</form>
The form object contains method and action properties that allow it to work without JavaScript (i.e. it submits data and reloads the page). It also has an attachment that progressively enhances the form when JavaScript is available, submitting data without reloading the entire page.

As with query, if the callback uses the submitted data, it should be validated by passing a Standard Schema as the first argument to form.

Fields
A form is composed of a set of fields, which are defined by the schema. In the case of createPost, we have two fields, title and content, which are both strings. To get the attributes for a field, call its .as(...) method, specifying which input type to use:


<form {...createPost}>
	<label>
		<h2>Title</h2>
		<input {...createPost.fields.title.as('text')} />
	</label>

	<label>
		<h2>Write your post</h2>
		<textarea {...createPost.fields.content.as('text')}></textarea>
	</label>

	<button>Publish!</button>
</form>
These attributes allow SvelteKit to set the correct input type, set a name that is used to construct the data passed to the handler, populate the value of the form (for example following a failed submission, to save the user having to re-enter everything), and set the aria-invalid state.

The generated name attribute uses JS object notation (e.g. nested.array[0].value). String keys that require quotes such as object['nested-array'][0].value are not supported. Under the hood, boolean checkbox and number field names are prefixed with b: and n:, respectively, to signal SvelteKit to coerce the values from strings prior to validation.

Fields can be nested in objects and arrays, and their values can be strings, numbers, booleans or File objects. For example, if your schema looked like this...

data.remote

const datingProfile = v.object({
	name: v.string(),
	photo: v.file(),
	info: v.object({
		height: v.number(),
		likesDogs: v.optional(v.boolean(), false)
	}),
	attributes: v.array(v.string())
});

export const createProfile = form(datingProfile, (data) => { /* ... */ });
...your form could look like this:


<script>
	import { createProfile } from './data.remote';

	const { name, photo, info, attributes } = createProfile.fields;
</script>

<form {...createProfile} enctype="multipart/form-data">
	<label>
		<input {...name.as('text')} /> Name
	</label>

	<label>
		<input {...photo.as('file')} /> Photo
	</label>

	<label>
		<input {...info.height.as('number')} /> Height (cm)
	</label>

	<label>
		<input {...info.likesDogs.as('checkbox')} /> I like dogs
	</label>

	<h2>My best attributes</h2>
	<input {...attributes[0].as('text')} />
	<input {...attributes[1].as('text')} />
	<input {...attributes[2].as('text')} />

	<button>submit</button>
</form>
Because our form contains a file input, we’ve added an enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute. The values for info.height and info.likesDogs are coerced to a number and a boolean respectively.

If a checkbox input is unchecked, the value is not included in the FormData object that SvelteKit constructs the data from. As such, we have to make the value optional in our schema. In Valibot that means using v.optional(v.boolean(), false) instead of just v.boolean(), whereas in Zod it would mean using z.coerce.boolean<boolean>().

In the case of radio and checkbox inputs that all belong to the same field, the value must be specified as a second argument to .as(...):

data.remote

export const survey = form(
	v.object({
		operatingSystem: v.picklist(['windows', 'mac', 'linux']),
		languages: v.optional(v.array(v.picklist(['html', 'css', 'js'])), [])
	}),
	(data) => { /* ... */ }
);

<form {...survey}>
	<h2>Which operating system do you use?</h2>

	{#each ['windows', 'mac', 'linux'] as os}
		<label>
			<input {...survey.fields.operatingSystem.as('radio', os)}>
			{os}
		</label>
	{/each}

	<h2>Which languages do you write code in?</h2>

	{#each ['html', 'css', 'js'] as language}
		<label>
			<input {...survey.fields.languages.as('checkbox', language)}>
			{language}
		</label>
	{/each}

	<button>submit</button>
</form>
Alternatively, you could use select and select multiple:


<form {...survey}>
	<h2>Which operating system do you use?</h2>

	<select {...survey.fields.operatingSystem.as('select')}>
		<option>windows</option>
		<option>mac</option>
		<option>linux</option>
	</select>

	<h2>Which languages do you write code in?</h2>

	<select {...survey.fields.languages.as('select multiple')}>
		<option>html</option>
		<option>css</option>
		<option>js</option>
	</select>

	<button>submit</button>
</form>
As with unchecked checkbox inputs, if no selections are made then the data will be undefined. For this reason, the languages field uses v.optional(v.array(...), []) rather than just v.array(...).

Programmatic validation
In addition to declarative schema validation, you can programmatically mark fields as invalid inside the form handler using the invalid function. This is useful for cases where you can’t know if something is valid until you try to perform some action:

src/routes/shop/data.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { form } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const buyHotcakes = form(
	v.object({
		qty: v.pipe(
			v.number(),
			v.minValue(1, 'you must buy at least one hotcake')
		)
	}),
	async (data, invalid) => {
		try {
			await db.buy(data.qty);
		} catch (e) {
			if (e.code === 'OUT_OF_STOCK') {
				invalid(
					invalid.qty(`we don't have enough hotcakes`)
				);
			}
		}
	}
);
The invalid function works as both a function and a proxy:

Call invalid(issue1, issue2, ...issueN) to throw a validation error
If an issue is a string, it applies to the form as a whole (and will show up in fields.allIssues())
Use invalid.fieldName(message) to create an issue for a specific field. Like fields this is type-safe and you can use regular property access syntax to create issues for deeply nested objects (e.g. invalid.profile.email('Email already exists') or invalid.items[0].qty('Insufficient stock'))
Validation
If the submitted data doesn’t pass the schema, the callback will not run. Instead, each invalid field’s issues() method will return an array of { message: string } objects, and the aria-invalid attribute (returned from as(...)) will be set to true:


<form {...createPost}>
	<label>
		<h2>Title</h2>

		{#each createPost.fields.title.issues() as issue}
			<p class="issue">{issue.message}</p>
		{/each}

		<input {...createPost.fields.title.as('text')} />
	</label>

	<label>
		<h2>Write your post</h2>

		{#each createPost.fields.content.issues() as issue}
			<p class="issue">{issue.message}</p>
		{/each}

		<textarea {...createPost.fields.content.as('text')}></textarea>
	</label>

	<button>Publish!</button>
</form>
You don’t need to wait until the form is submitted to validate the data — you can call validate() programmatically, for example in an oninput callback (which will validate the data on every keystroke) or an onchange callback:


<form {...createPost} oninput={() => createPost.validate()}>
	<!-- -->
</form>
By default, issues will be ignored if they belong to form controls that haven’t yet been interacted with. To validate all inputs, call validate({ includeUntouched: true }).

For client-side validation, you can specify a preflight schema which will populate issues() and prevent data being sent to the server if the data doesn’t validate:


<script>
	import * as v from 'valibot';
	import { createPost } from '../data.remote';

	const schema = v.object({
		title: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty()),
		content: v.pipe(v.string(), v.nonEmpty())
	});
</script>

<h1>Create a new post</h1>

<form {...createPost.preflight(schema)}>
	<!-- -->
</form>
The preflight schema can be the same object as your server-side schema, if appropriate, though it won’t be able to do server-side checks like ‘this value already exists in the database’. Note that you cannot export a schema from a .remote.ts or .remote.js file, so the schema must either be exported from a shared module, or from a <script module> block in the component containing the <form>.

To get a list of all issues, rather than just those belonging to a single field, you can use the fields.allIssues() method:


{#each createPost.fields.allIssues() as issue}
	<p>{issue.message}</p>
{/each}
Getting/setting inputs
Each field has a value() method that reflects its current value. As the user interacts with the form, it is automatically updated:


<form {...createPost}>
	<!-- -->
</form>

<div class="preview">
	<h2>{createPost.fields.title.value()}</h2>
	<div>{@html render(createPost.fields.content.value())}</div>
</div>
Alternatively, createPost.fields.value() would return a { title, content } object.

You can update a field (or a collection of fields) via the set(...) method:


<script>
	import { createPost } from '../data.remote';

	// this...
	createPost.fields.set({
		title: 'My new blog post',
		content: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'
	});

	// ...is equivalent to this:
	createPost.fields.title.set('My new blog post');
	createPost.fields.content.set('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet');
</script>
Handling sensitive data
In the case of a non-progressively-enhanced form submission (i.e. where JavaScript is unavailable, for whatever reason) value() is also populated if the submitted data is invalid, so that the user does not need to fill the entire form out from scratch.

You can prevent sensitive data (such as passwords and credit card numbers) from being sent back to the user by using a name with a leading underscore:


<form {...register}>
	<label>
		Username
		<input {...register.fields.username.as('text')} />
	</label>

	<label>
		Password
		<input {...register.fields._password.as('password')} />
	</label>

	<button>Sign up!</button>
</form>
In this example, if the data does not validate, only the first <input> will be populated when the page reloads.

Single-flight mutations
By default, all queries used on the page (along with any load functions) are automatically refreshed following a successful form submission. This ensures that everything is up-to-date, but it’s also inefficient: many queries will be unchanged, and it requires a second trip to the server to get the updated data.

Instead, we can specify which queries should be refreshed in response to a particular form submission. This is called a single-flight mutation, and there are two ways to achieve it. The first is to refresh the query on the server, inside the form handler:


export const getPosts = query(async () => { /* ... */ });

export const getPost = query(v.string(), async (slug) => { /* ... */ });

export const createPost = form(
	v.object({/* ... */}),
	async (data) => {
		// form logic goes here...

		// Refresh `getPosts()` on the server, and send
		// the data back with the result of `createPost`
		await getPosts().refresh();

		// Redirect to the newly created page
		redirect(303, `/blog/${slug}`);
	}
);

export const updatePost = form(
	v.object({/* ... */}),
	async (data) => {
		// form logic goes here...
		const result = externalApi.update(post);

		// The API already gives us the updated post,
		// no need to refresh it, we can set it directly
		await getPost(post.id).set(result);
	}
);
The second is to drive the single-flight mutation from the client, which we’ll see in the section on enhance.

Returns and redirects
The example above uses redirect(...), which sends the user to the newly created page. Alternatively, the callback could return data, in which case it would be available as createPost.result:

src/routes/blog/data.remote

export const createPost = form(
	v.object({/* ... */}),
	async (data) => {
		// ...

		return { success: true };
	}
);
src/routes/blog/new/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { createPost } from '../data.remote';
</script>

<h1>Create a new post</h1>

<form {...createPost}>
	<!-- -->
</form>

{#if createPost.result?.success}
	<p>Successfully published!</p>
{/if}
This value is ephemeral — it will vanish if you resubmit, navigate away, or reload the page.

The result value need not indicate success — it can also contain validation errors, along with any data that should repopulate the form on page reload.

If an error occurs during submission, the nearest +error.svelte page will be rendered.

enhance
We can customize what happens when the form is submitted with the enhance method:

src/routes/blog/new/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { createPost } from '../data.remote';
	import { showToast } from '$lib/toast';
</script>

<h1>Create a new post</h1>

<form {...createPost.enhance(async ({ form, data, submit }) => {
	try {
		await submit();
		form.reset();

		showToast('Successfully published!');
	} catch (error) {
		showToast('Oh no! Something went wrong');
	}
})}>
	<!-- -->
</form>
When using enhance, the <form> is not automatically reset — you must call form.reset() if you want to clear the inputs.

The callback receives the form element, the data it contains, and a submit function.

To enable client-driven single-flight mutations, use submit().updates(...). For example, if the getPosts() query was used on this page, we could refresh it like so:


await submit().updates(getPosts());
We can also override the current data while the submission is ongoing:


await submit().updates(
	getPosts().withOverride((posts) => [newPost, ...posts])
);
The override will be applied immediately, and released when the submission completes (or fails).

Multiple instances of a form
Some forms may be repeated as part of a list. In this case you can create separate instances of a form function via for(id) to achieve isolation.

src/routes/todos/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getTodos, modifyTodo } from '../data.remote';
</script>

<h1>Todos</h1>

{#each await getTodos() as todo}
	{@const modify = modifyTodo.for(todo.id)}
	<form {...modify}>
		<!-- -->
		<button disabled={!!modify.pending}>save changes</button>
	</form>
{/each}
buttonProps
By default, submitting a form will send a request to the URL indicated by the <form> element’s action attribute, which in the case of a remote function is a property on the form object generated by SvelteKit.

It’s possible for a <button> inside the <form> to send the request to a different URL, using the formaction attribute. For example, you might have a single form that allows you to log in or register depending on which button was clicked.

This attribute exists on the buttonProps property of a form object:

src/routes/login/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { login, register } from '$lib/auth';
</script>

<form {...login}>
	<label>
		Your username
		<input {...login.fields.username.as('text')} />
	</label>

	<label>
		Your password
		<input {...login.fields._password.as('password')} />
	</label>

	<button>login</button>
	<button {...register.buttonProps}>register</button>
</form>
Like the form object itself, buttonProps has an enhance method for customizing submission behaviour.

command
The command function, like form, allows you to write data to the server. Unlike form, it’s not specific to an element and can be called from anywhere.

Prefer form where possible, since it gracefully degrades if JavaScript is disabled or fails to load.

As with query and form, if the function accepts an argument, it should be validated by passing a Standard Schema as the first argument to command.

likes.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { query, command } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getLikes = query(v.string(), async (id) => {
	const [row] = await db.sql`
		SELECT likes
		FROM item
		WHERE id = ${id}
	`;

	return row.likes;
});

export const addLike = command(v.string(), async (id) => {
	await db.sql`
		UPDATE item
		SET likes = likes + 1
		WHERE id = ${id}
	`;
});
Now simply call addLike, from (for example) an event handler:

+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { getLikes, addLike } from './likes.remote';
	import { showToast } from '$lib/toast';

	let { item } = $props();
</script>

<button
	onclick={async () => {
		try {
			await addLike(item.id);
		} catch (error) {
			showToast('Something went wrong!');
		}
	}}
>
	add like
</button>

<p>likes: {await getLikes(item.id)}</p>
Commands cannot be called during render.

Updating queries
To update getLikes(item.id), or any other query, we need to tell SvelteKit which queries need to be refreshed (unlike form, which by default invalidates everything, to approximate the behaviour of a native form submission).

We either do that inside the command itself...

likes.remote

export const getLikes = query(v.string(), async (id) => { /* ... */ });

export const addLike = command(v.string(), async (id) => {
	await db.sql`
		UPDATE item
		SET likes = likes + 1
		WHERE id = ${id}
	`;

	getLikes(id).refresh();
	// Just like within form functions you can also do
	// getLikes(id).set(...)
	// in case you have the result already
});
...or when we call it:


try {
	await addLike(item.id).updates(getLikes(item.id));
} catch (error) {
	showToast('Something went wrong!');
}
As before, we can use withOverride for optimistic updates:


try {
	await addLike(item.id).updates(
		getLikes(item.id).withOverride((n) => n + 1)
	);
} catch (error) {
	showToast('Something went wrong!');
}
prerender
The prerender function is similar to query, except that it will be invoked at build time to prerender the result. Use this for data that changes at most once per redeployment.

src/routes/blog/data.remote

import { prerender } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getPosts = prerender(async () => {
	const posts = await db.sql`
		SELECT title, slug
		FROM post
		ORDER BY published_at
		DESC
	`;

	return posts;
});
You can use prerender functions on pages that are otherwise dynamic, allowing for partial prerendering of your data. This results in very fast navigation, since prerendered data can live on a CDN along with your other static assets.

In the browser, prerendered data is saved using the Cache API. This cache survives page reloads, and will be cleared when the user first visits a new deployment of your app.

When the entire page has export const prerender = true, you cannot use queries, as they are dynamic.

Prerender arguments
As with queries, prerender functions can accept an argument, which should be validated with a Standard Schema:

src/routes/blog/data.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { prerender } from '$app/server';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';

export const getPosts = prerender(async () => { /* ... */ });

export const getPost = prerender(v.string(), async (slug) => {
	const [post] = await db.sql`
		SELECT * FROM post
		WHERE slug = ${slug}
	`;

	if (!post) error(404, 'Not found');
	return post;
});
Any calls to getPost(...) found by SvelteKit’s crawler while prerendering pages will be saved automatically, but you can also specify which values it should be called with using the inputs option:

src/routes/blog/data.remote

export const getPost = prerender(
	v.string(),
	async (slug) => { /* ... */ },
	{
		inputs: () => [
			'first-post',
			'second-post',
			'third-post'
		]
	}
);
Svelte does not yet support asynchronous server-side rendering, so it’s likely that you’re only calling remote functions from the browser, rather than during prerendering. Because of this, you will need to use inputs, for now. We’re actively working on this roadblock.

By default, prerender functions are excluded from your server bundle, which means that you cannot call them with any arguments that were not prerendered. You can set dynamic: true to change this behaviour:

src/routes/blog/data.remote

export const getPost = prerender(
	v.string(),
	async (slug) => { /* ... */ },
	{
		dynamic: true,
		inputs: () => [
			'first-post',
			'second-post',
			'third-post'
		]
	}
);
Handling validation errors
As long as you’re not passing invalid data to your remote functions, there are only two reasons why the argument passed to a command, query or prerender function would fail validation:

the function signature changed between deployments, and some users are currently on an older version of your app
someone is trying to attack your site by poking your exposed endpoints with bad data
In the second case, we don’t want to give the attacker any help, so SvelteKit will generate a generic 400 Bad Request response. You can control the message by implementing the handleValidationError server hook, which, like handleError, must return an App.Error (which defaults to { message: string }):

src/hooks.server

import type { HandleValidationError } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handleValidationError: HandleValidationError = ({ event, issues }) => {
	return {
		message: 'Nice try, hacker!'
	};
};
If you know what you’re doing and want to opt out of validation, you can pass the string 'unchecked' in place of a schema:

data.remote

import { query } from '$app/server';

export const getStuff = query('unchecked', async ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
	// the shape might not actually be what TypeScript thinks
	// since bad actors might call this function with other arguments
});
Using getRequestEvent
Inside query, form and command you can use getRequestEvent to get the current RequestEvent object. This makes it easy to build abstractions for interacting with cookies, for example:

user.remote

import { getRequestEvent, query } from '$app/server';
import { findUser } from '$lib/server/database';

export const getProfile = query(async () => {
	const user = await getUser();

	return {
		name: user.name,
		avatar: user.avatar
	};
});

// this query could be called from multiple places, but
// the function will only run once per request
const getUser = query(async () => {
	const { cookies } = getRequestEvent();

	return await findUser(cookies.get('session_id'));
});
Note that some properties of RequestEvent are different inside remote functions:

you cannot set headers (other than writing cookies, and then only inside form and command functions)
route, params and url relate to the page the remote function was called from, not the URL of the endpoint SvelteKit creates for the remote function. Queries are not re-run when the user navigates (unless the argument to the query changes as a result of navigation), and so you should be mindful of how you use these values. In particular, never use them to determine whether or not a user is authorized to access certain data.
Redirects
Inside query, form and prerender functions it is possible to use the redirect(...) function. It is not possible inside command functions, as you should avoid redirecting here. (If you absolutely have to, you can return a { redirect: location } object and deal with it in the client.)

Building your app

Building your app
During the build
Preview your app
Building a SvelteKit app happens in two stages, which both happen when you run vite build (usually via npm run build).

Firstly, Vite creates an optimized production build of your server code, your browser code, and your service worker (if you have one). Prerendering is executed at this stage, if appropriate.

Secondly, an adapter takes this production build and tunes it for your target environment — more on this on the following pages.

During the build
SvelteKit will load your +page/layout(.server).js files (and all files they import) for analysis during the build. Any code that should not be executed at this stage must check that building from $app/environment is false:


import { building } from '$app/environment';
import { setupMyDatabase } from '$lib/server/database';

if (!building) {
	setupMyDatabase();
}

export function load() {
	// ...
}
Preview your app
After building, you can view your production build locally with vite preview (via npm run preview). Note that this will run the app in Node, and so is not a perfect reproduction of your deployed app — adapter-specific adjustments like the platform object do not apply to previews.
SvelteKitBuild and deploy
Adapters
On this page
Adapters
Using adapters
Platform-specific context
Before you can deploy your SvelteKit app, you need to adapt it for your deployment target. Adapters are small plugins that take the built app as input and generate output for deployment.

Official adapters exist for a variety of platforms — these are documented on the following pages:

@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare for Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages
@sveltejs/adapter-netlify for Netlify
@sveltejs/adapter-node for Node servers
@sveltejs/adapter-static for static site generation (SSG)
@sveltejs/adapter-vercel for Vercel
Additional community-provided adapters exist for other platforms.

Using adapters
Your adapter is specified in svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

import adapter from 'svelte-adapter-foo';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// adapter options go here
		})
	}
};

export default config;
Platform-specific context
Some adapters may have access to additional information about the request. For example, Cloudflare Workers can access an env object containing KV namespaces etc. This can be passed to the RequestEvent used in hooks and server routes as the platform property — consult each adapter’s documentation to learn more.
SvelteKitBuild and deploy
Zero-config deployments

Zero-config deployments
Environment-specific configuration
Adding community adapters
When you create a new SvelteKit project with npx sv create, it installs adapter-auto by default. This adapter automatically installs and uses the correct adapter for supported environments when you deploy:

@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare for Cloudflare Pages
@sveltejs/adapter-netlify for Netlify
@sveltejs/adapter-vercel for Vercel
svelte-adapter-azure-swa for Azure Static Web Apps
svelte-kit-sst for AWS via SST
@sveltejs/adapter-node for Google Cloud Run
It’s recommended to install the appropriate adapter to your devDependencies once you’ve settled on a target environment, since this will add the adapter to your lockfile and slightly improve install times on CI.

Environment-specific configuration
To add configuration options, such as { edge: true } in adapter-vercel and adapter-netlify, you must install the underlying adapter — adapter-auto does not take any options.

Adding community adapters
You can add zero-config support for additional adapters by editing adapters.js and opening a pull request.

Usage

Environment variables
Options
Graceful shutdown
Socket activation
Custom server
To generate a standalone Node server, use adapter-node.

Usage
Install with npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-node, then add the adapter to your svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter()
	}
};

export default config;
Deploying
First, build your app with npm run build. This will create the production server in the output directory specified in the adapter options, defaulting to build.

You will need the output directory, the project’s package.json, and the production dependencies in node_modules to run the application. Production dependencies can be generated by copying the package.json and package-lock.json and then running npm ci --omit dev (you can skip this step if your app doesn’t have any dependencies). You can then start your app with this command:


node build
Development dependencies will be bundled into your app using Rollup. To control whether a given package is bundled or externalised, place it in devDependencies or dependencies respectively in your package.json.

Compressing responses
You will typically want to compress responses coming from the server. If you’re already deploying your server behind a reverse proxy for SSL or load balancing, it typically results in better performance to also handle compression at that layer since Node.js is single-threaded.

However, if you’re building a custom server and do want to add a compression middleware there, note that we would recommend using @polka/compression since SvelteKit streams responses and the more popular compression package does not support streaming and may cause errors when used.

Environment variables
In dev and preview, SvelteKit will read environment variables from your .env file (or .env.local, or .env.[mode], as determined by Vite.)

In production, .env files are not automatically loaded. To do so, install dotenv in your project...


npm install dotenv
...and invoke it before running the built app:


node -r dotenv/config build
If you use Node.js v20.6+, you can use the --env-file flag instead:


node --env-file=.env build
PORT, HOST and SOCKET_PATH
By default, the server will accept connections on 0.0.0.0 using port 3000. These can be customised with the PORT and HOST environment variables:


HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=4000 node build
Alternatively, the server can be configured to accept connections on a specified socket path. When this is done using the SOCKET_PATH environment variable, the HOST and PORT environment variables will be disregarded.


SOCKET_PATH=/tmp/socket node build
ORIGIN, PROTOCOL_HEADER, HOST_HEADER, and PORT_HEADER
HTTP doesn’t give SvelteKit a reliable way to know the URL that is currently being requested. The simplest way to tell SvelteKit where the app is being served is to set the ORIGIN environment variable:


ORIGIN=https://my.site node build

# or e.g. for local previewing and testing
ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 node build
With this, a request for the /stuff pathname will correctly resolve to https://my.site/stuff. Alternatively, you can specify headers that tell SvelteKit about the request protocol and host, from which it can construct the origin URL:


PROTOCOL_HEADER=x-forwarded-proto HOST_HEADER=x-forwarded-host node build
x-forwarded-proto and x-forwarded-host are de facto standard headers that forward the original protocol and host if you’re using a reverse proxy (think load balancers and CDNs). You should only set these variables if your server is behind a trusted reverse proxy; otherwise, it’d be possible for clients to spoof these headers.

If you’re hosting your proxy on a non-standard port and your reverse proxy supports x-forwarded-port, you can also set PORT_HEADER=x-forwarded-port.

If adapter-node can’t correctly determine the URL of your deployment, you may experience this error when using form actions:

Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden

ADDRESS_HEADER and XFF_DEPTH
The RequestEvent object passed to hooks and endpoints includes an event.getClientAddress() function that returns the client’s IP address. By default this is the connecting remoteAddress. If your server is behind one or more proxies (such as a load balancer), this value will contain the innermost proxy’s IP address rather than the client’s, so we need to specify an ADDRESS_HEADER to read the address from:


ADDRESS_HEADER=True-Client-IP node build
Headers can easily be spoofed. As with PROTOCOL_HEADER and HOST_HEADER, you should know what you’re doing before setting these.

If the ADDRESS_HEADER is X-Forwarded-For, the header value will contain a comma-separated list of IP addresses. The XFF_DEPTH environment variable should specify how many trusted proxies sit in front of your server. E.g. if there are three trusted proxies, proxy 3 will forward the addresses of the original connection and the first two proxies:

<client address>, <proxy 1 address>, <proxy 2 address>
Some guides will tell you to read the left-most address, but this leaves you vulnerable to spoofing:

<spoofed address>, <client address>, <proxy 1 address>, <proxy 2 address>
We instead read from the right, accounting for the number of trusted proxies. In this case, we would use XFF_DEPTH=3.

If you need to read the left-most address instead (and don’t care about spoofing) — for example, to offer a geolocation service, where it’s more important for the IP address to be real than trusted, you can do so by inspecting the x-forwarded-for header within your app.

BODY_SIZE_LIMIT
The maximum request body size to accept in bytes including while streaming. The body size can also be specified with a unit suffix for kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G). For example, 512K or 1M. Defaults to 512kb. You can disable this option with a value of Infinity (0 in older versions of the adapter) and implement a custom check in handle if you need something more advanced.

SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT
The number of seconds to wait before forcefully closing any remaining connections after receiving a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal. Defaults to 30. Internally the adapter calls closeAllConnections. See Graceful shutdown for more details.

IDLE_TIMEOUT
When using systemd socket activation, IDLE_TIMEOUT specifies the number of seconds after which the app is automatically put to sleep when receiving no requests. If not set, the app runs continuously. See Socket activation for more details.

Options
The adapter can be configured with various options:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// default options are shown
			out: 'build',
			precompress: true,
			envPrefix: ''
		})
	}
};

export default config;
out
The directory to build the server to. It defaults to build — i.e. node build would start the server locally after it has been created.

precompress
Enables precompressing using gzip and brotli for assets and prerendered pages. It defaults to true.

envPrefix
If you need to change the name of the environment variables used to configure the deployment (for example, to deconflict with environment variables you don’t control), you can specify a prefix:


envPrefix: 'MY_CUSTOM_';

MY_CUSTOM_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
MY_CUSTOM_PORT=4000 \
MY_CUSTOM_ORIGIN=https://my.site \
node build
Graceful shutdown
By default adapter-node gracefully shuts down the HTTP server when a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal is received. It will:

reject new requests (server.close)
wait for requests that have already been made but not received a response yet to finish and close connections once they become idle (server.closeIdleConnections)
and finally, close any remaining connections that are still active after SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT seconds. (server.closeAllConnections)
If you want to customize this behaviour you can use a custom server.

You can listen to the sveltekit:shutdown event which is emitted after the HTTP server has closed all connections. Unlike Node’s exit event, the sveltekit:shutdown event supports asynchronous operations and is always emitted when all connections are closed even if the server has dangling work such as open database connections.


process.on('sveltekit:shutdown', async (reason) => {
  await jobs.stop();
  await db.close();
});
The parameter reason has one of the following values:

SIGINT - shutdown was triggered by a SIGINT signal
SIGTERM - shutdown was triggered by a SIGTERM signal
IDLE - shutdown was triggered by IDLE_TIMEOUT
Socket activation
Most Linux operating systems today use a modern process manager called systemd to start the server and run and manage services. You can configure your server to allocate a socket and start and scale your app on demand. This is called socket activation. In this case, the OS will pass two environment variables to your app — LISTEN_PID and LISTEN_FDS. The adapter will then listen on file descriptor 3 which refers to a systemd socket unit that you will have to create.

You can still use envPrefix with systemd socket activation. LISTEN_PID and LISTEN_FDS are always read without a prefix.

To take advantage of socket activation follow these steps.

Run your app as a systemd service. It can either run directly on the host system or inside a container (using Docker or a systemd portable service for example). If you additionally pass an IDLE_TIMEOUT environment variable to your app it will gracefully shutdown if there are no requests for IDLE_TIMEOUT seconds. systemd will automatically start your app again when new requests are coming in.

Make sure systemd has recognised both units by running sudo systemctl daemon-reload. Then enable the socket on boot and start it immediately using sudo systemctl enable --now myapp.socket. The app will then automatically start once the first request is made to localhost:3000.
Custom server
The adapter creates two files in your build directory — index.js and handler.js. Running index.js — e.g. node build, if you use the default build directory — will start a server on the configured port.

Alternatively, you can import the handler.js file, which exports a handler suitable for use with Express, Connect or Polka (or even just the built-in http.createServer) and set up your own server:

my-server

import { handler } from './build/handler.js';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// add a route that lives separately from the SvelteKit app
app.get('/healthcheck', (req, res) => {

	res.end('ok');
});

// let SvelteKit handle everything else, including serving prerendered pages and static assets
app.use(handler);

app.listen(3000, () => {
	console.log('listening on port 3000');
});
Static site generation
On this page
Static site generation
Usage
Zero-config support
Options
GitHub Pages
To use SvelteKit as a static site generator (SSG), use adapter-static.

This will prerender your entire site as a collection of static files. If you’d like to prerender only some pages and dynamically server-render others, you will need to use a different adapter together with the prerender option.

Usage
Install with npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static, then add the adapter to your svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// default options are shown. On some platforms
			// these options are set automatically — see below
			pages: 'build',
			assets: 'build',
			fallback: undefined,
			precompress: false,
			strict: true
		})
	}
};

export default config;
...and add the prerender option to your root layout:

src/routes/+layout

// If you're using a fallback (i.e. SPA mode) you don't need to prerender all
// pages by setting this here, but should prerender as many as possible to
// avoid large performance and SEO impacts
export const prerender = true;
You must ensure SvelteKit’s trailingSlash option is set appropriately for your environment. If your host does not render /a.html upon receiving a request for /a then you will need to set trailingSlash: 'always' in your root layout to create /a/index.html instead.

Zero-config support
Some platforms have zero-config support (more to come in future):

Vercel
On these platforms, you should omit the adapter options so that adapter-static can provide the optimal configuration:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({...})
	}
};

export default config;
Options
pages
The directory to write prerendered pages to. It defaults to build.

assets
The directory to write static assets (the contents of static, plus client-side JS and CSS generated by SvelteKit) to. Ordinarily this should be the same as pages, and it will default to whatever the value of pages is, but in rare circumstances you might need to output pages and assets to separate locations.

fallback
To create a single page app (SPA) you must specify the name of the fallback page to be generated by SvelteKit, which is used as the entry point for URLs that have not been prerendered. This is commonly 200.html, but can vary depending on your deployment platform. You should avoid index.html where possible to avoid conflicting with a prerendered homepage.

This option has large negative performance and SEO impacts. It is only recommended in certain circumstances such as wrapping the site in a mobile app. See the single page apps documentation for more details and alternatives.

precompress
If true, precompresses files with brotli and gzip. This will generate .br and .gz files.

strict
By default, adapter-static checks that either all pages and endpoints (if any) of your app were prerendered, or you have the fallback option set. This check exists to prevent you from accidentally publishing an app where some parts of it are not accessible, because they are not contained in the final output. If you know this is ok (for example when a certain page only exists conditionally), you can set strict to false to turn off this check.

GitHub Pages
When building for GitHub Pages, if your repo name is not equivalent to your-username.github.io, make sure to update config.kit.paths.base to match your repo name. This is because the site will be served from https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name rather than from the root.

You’ll also want to generate a fallback 404.html page to replace the default 404 page shown by GitHub Pages.

A config for GitHub Pages might look like the following:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			fallback: '404.html'
		}),
		paths: {
			base: process.argv.includes('dev') ? '' : process.env.BASE_PATH
		}
	}
};

export default config;
You can use GitHub actions to automatically deploy your site to GitHub Pages when you make a change. Here’s an example workflow:

.github/workflows/deploy

name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: 'main'

jobs:
  build_site:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # If you're using pnpm, add this step then change the commands and cache key below to use `pnpm`
      # - name: Install pnpm
      #   uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
      #   with:
      #     version: 8

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
 node-version: 20
 cache: npm

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm i

      - name: build
        env:
 BASE_PATH: '/${{ github.event.repository.name }}'
        run: |
 npm run build

      - name: Upload Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
 # this should match the `pages` option in your adapter-static options
 path: 'build/'

  deploy:
    needs: build_site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
If you’re not using GitHub actions to deploy your site (for example, you’re pushing the built site to its own repo), add an empty .nojekyll file in your static directory to prevent Jekyll from interfering.
Single-page apps
On this page
Single-page apps
Usage
Prerendering individual pages
Apache
You can turn a SvelteKit app into a fully client-rendered single-page app (SPA) by specifying a fallback page. This page will be served for any URLs that can’t be served by other means such as returning a prerendered page.

SPA mode has a large negative performance impact by forcing multiple network round trips (for the blank HTML document, then for the JavaScript, and then for any data needed for the page) before content can be shown. Unless you are serving the app from a local network (e.g. a mobile app that wraps a locally-served SPA) this will delay startup, especially when considering the latency of mobile devices. It also harms SEO by often causing sites to be downranked for performance (SPAs are much more likely to fail Core Web Vitals), excluding search engines that don’t render JS, and causing your site to receive less frequent updates from those that do. And finally, it makes your app inaccessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens more often than you probably think).

You can avoid these drawbacks by prerendering as many pages as possible when using SPA mode (especially your homepage). If you can prerender all pages, you can simply use static site generation rather than a SPA. Otherwise, you should strongly consider using an adapter which supports server side rendering. SvelteKit has officially supported adapters for various providers with generous free tiers.

Usage
First, disable SSR for the pages you don’t want to prerender. These pages will be served via the fallback page; for example, to serve all pages via the fallback by default, you can update the root layout as shown below. You should opt back into prerendering individual pages and directories where possible.

src/routes/+layout

export const ssr = false;
If you don’t have any server-side logic (i.e. +page.server.js, +layout.server.js or +server.js files) you can use adapter-static to create your SPA. Install adapter-static with npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static and add it to your svelte.config.js with the fallback option:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			fallback: '200.html' // may differ from host to host
		})
	}
};

export default config;
The fallback page is an HTML page created by SvelteKit from your page template (e.g. app.html) that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. For example Surge, a static web host, lets you add a 200.html file that will handle any requests that don’t correspond to static assets or prerendered pages.

On some hosts it may be something else entirely — consult your platform’s documentation. We recommend avoiding index.html if possible as it may conflict with prerendering.

Note that the fallback page will always contain absolute asset paths (i.e. beginning with / rather than .) regardless of the value of paths.relative, since it is used to respond to requests for arbitrary paths.

Prerendering individual pages
If you want certain pages to be prerendered, you can re-enable ssr alongside prerender for just those parts of your app:

src/routes/my-prerendered-page/+page

export const prerender = true;
export const ssr = true;
You won’t need a Node server or server capable of running JavaScript to deploy this page. It will only server render your page while building your project for the purposes of outputting an .html page that can be served from any static web host.

Apache
To run an SPA on Apache, you should add a static/.htaccess file to route requests to the fallback page:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
	RewriteRule ^200\.html$ - [L]
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
	RewriteRule . /200.html [L]

Migrating from Workers Sites
To deploy to Cloudflare Workers or Cloudflare Pages, use adapter-cloudflare.

This adapter will be installed by default when you use adapter-auto. If you plan on staying with Cloudflare, you can switch from adapter-auto to using this adapter directly so that event.platform is emulated during local development, type declarations are automatically applied, and the ability to set Cloudflare-specific options is provided.

Comparisons
adapter-cloudflare – supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers Static Assets and Cloudflare Pages
adapter-cloudflare-workers – deprecated. Supports all SvelteKit features; builds for Cloudflare Workers Sites
adapter-static – only produces client-side static assets; compatible with Cloudflare Workers Static Assets and Cloudflare Pages
Usage
Install with npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare, then add the adapter to your svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// See below for an explanation of these options
			config: undefined,
			platformProxy: {
				configPath: undefined,
				environment: undefined,
				persist: undefined
			},
			fallback: 'plaintext',
			routes: {
				include: ['/*'],
				exclude: ['<all>']
			}
		})
	}
};

export default config;
Options
config
Path to your Wrangler configuration file. If you would like to use a Wrangler configuration filename other than wrangler.jsonc, wrangler.json, or wrangler.toml you can specify it using this option.

platformProxy
Preferences for the emulated platform.env local bindings. See the getPlatformProxy Wrangler API documentation for a full list of options.

fallback
Whether to render a plaintext 404.html page or a rendered SPA fallback page for non-matching asset requests.

For Cloudflare Workers, the default behaviour is to return a null-body 404-status response for non-matching assets requests. However, if the assets.not_found_handling Wrangler configuration setting is set to "404-page", this page will be served if a request fails to match an asset. If assets.not_found_handling is set to "single-page-application", the adapter will render a SPA fallback index.html page regardless of the fallback option specified.

For Cloudflare Pages, this page will only be served when a request that matches an entry in routes.exclude fails to match an asset.

Most of the time plaintext is sufficient, but if you are using routes.exclude to manually exclude a set of prerendered pages without exceeding the 100 route limit, you may wish to use spa instead to avoid showing an unstyled 404 page to users.

See Cloudflare Pages’ Not Found behaviour for more info.

routes
Only for Cloudflare Pages. Allows you to customise the _routes.json file generated by adapter-cloudflare.

include defines routes that will invoke a function, and defaults to ['/*']
exclude defines routes that will not invoke a function — this is a faster and cheaper way to serve your app’s static assets. This array can include the following special values:
<build> contains your app’s build artifacts (the files generated by Vite)
<files> contains the contents of your static directory
<prerendered> contains a list of prerendered pages
<all> (the default) contains all of the above
You can have up to 100 include and exclude rules combined. Generally you can omit the routes options, but if (for example) your <prerendered> paths exceed that limit, you may find it helpful to manually create an exclude list that includes '/articles/*' instead of the auto-generated ['/articles/foo', '/articles/bar', '/articles/baz', ...].

Cloudflare Workers
Basic configuration
When building for Cloudflare Workers, this adapter expects to find a Wrangler configuration file in the project root. It should look something like this:

wrangler

{
	"name": "<any-name-you-want>",
	"main": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare/_worker.js",
	"compatibility_date": "2025-01-01",
	"assets": {
		"binding": "ASSETS",
		"directory": ".svelte-kit/cloudflare",
	}
}
Deployment
Please follow the framework guide for Cloudflare Workers to begin.

Cloudflare Pages
Deployment
Please follow the Get Started Guide for Cloudflare Pages to begin.

If you’re using the Git integration, your build settings should look like this:

Framework preset – SvelteKit
Build command – npm run build or vite build
Build output directory – .svelte-kit/cloudflare
Further reading
You may wish to refer to Cloudflare’s documentation for deploying a SvelteKit site on Cloudflare Pages.

Notes
Functions contained in the /functions directory at the project’s root will not be included in the deployment. Instead, functions should be implemented as server endpoints in your SvelteKit app, which is compiled to a single _worker.js file.

Runtime APIs
The env object contains your project’s bindings, which consist of KV/DO namespaces, etc. It is passed to SvelteKit via the platform property, along with ctx, caches, and cf, meaning that you can access it in hooks and endpoints:

+server

import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';
export const POST: RequestHandler = async ({ request, platform }) => {
	const x = platform?.env.YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE.idFromName('x');
};
SvelteKit’s built-in $env module should be preferred for environment variables.

To make these types available to your app, install @cloudflare/workers-types and reference them in your src/app.d.ts:

src/app.d

import { KVNamespace, DurableObjectNamespace } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Platform {
			env: {
				YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
				YOUR_DURABLE_OBJECT_NAMESPACE: DurableObjectNamespace;
			};
		}
	}
}

export {};
Testing locally
Cloudflare specific values in the platform property are emulated during dev and preview modes. Local bindings are created based on your Wrangler configuration file and are used to populate platform.env during development and preview. Use the adapter config platformProxy option to change your preferences for the bindings.

For testing the build, you should use Wrangler version 4. Once you have built your site, run wrangler dev .svelte-kit/cloudflare if you’re testing for Cloudflare Workers or wrangler pages dev .svelte-kit/cloudflare for Cloudflare Pages.

Headers and redirects
The _headers and _redirects files, specific to Cloudflare, can be used for static asset responses (like images) by putting them into the project root folder.

However, they will have no effect on responses dynamically rendered by SvelteKit, which should return custom headers or redirect responses from server endpoints or with the handle hook.

Troubleshooting
Node.js compatibility
If you would like to enable Node.js compatibility, you can add the nodejs_compat compatibility flag to your Wrangler configuration file:

wrangler

{
	"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
}
Worker size limits
When deploying your application, the server generated by SvelteKit is bundled into a single file. Wrangler will fail to publish your worker if it exceeds the size limits after minification. You’re unlikely to hit this limit usually, but some large libraries can cause this to happen. In that case, you can try to reduce the size of your worker by only importing such libraries on the client side. See the FAQ for more information.

Accessing the file system
You can’t use fs in Cloudflare Workers.

Instead, use the read function from $app/server to access your files. It works by fetching the file from the deployed public assets location.

Alternatively, you can prerender the routes in question.

Migrating from Workers Sites
Cloudflare no longer recommends using Workers Sites and instead recommends using Workers Static Assets. To migrate, replace @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers with @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare and remove all site configuration settings from your Wrangler configuration file, then add the assets.directory and assets.binding configuration settings:

svelte.config.js
svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers';
import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {

	}
};

<your-service-name> can be anything. <your-account-id> can be found by running wrangler whoami using the Wrangler CLI tool or by logging into your Cloudflare dashboard and grabbing it from the end of the URL:

https://dash.cloudflare.com/<your-account-id>/home
You should add the .cloudflare directory (or whichever directories you specified for main and site.bucket) and the .wrangler directory to your .gitignore.

You will need to install Wrangler and log in, if you haven’t already:


npm i -D wrangler
wrangler login
Then, you can build your app and deploy it:

Netlify
On this page
Netlify
Usage
Netlify Edge Functions
Netlify alternatives to SvelteKit functionality
Troubleshooting
To deploy to Netlify, use adapter-netlify.

This adapter will be installed by default when you use adapter-auto, but adding it to your project allows you to specify Netlify-specific options.

Usage
Install with npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-netlify, then add the adapter to your svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		// default options are shown
		adapter: adapter({
			// if true, will create a Netlify Edge Function rather
			// than using standard Node-based functions
			edge: false,

			// if true, will split your app into multiple functions
			// instead of creating a single one for the entire app.
			// if `edge` is true, this option cannot be used
			split: false
		})
	}
};

export default config;
Then, make sure you have a netlify.toml file in the project root. This will determine where to write static assets based on the build.publish settings, as per this sample configuration:


[build]
	command = "npm run build"
	publish = "build"
If the netlify.toml file or the build.publish value is missing, a default value of "build" will be used. Note that if you have set the publish directory in the Netlify UI to something else then you will need to set it in netlify.toml too, or use the default value of "build".

Node version
New projects will use the current Node LTS version by default. However, if you’re upgrading a project you created a while ago it may be stuck on an older version. See the Netlify docs for details on manually specifying a current Node version.

Netlify Edge Functions
SvelteKit supports Netlify Edge Functions. If you pass the option edge: true to the adapter function, server-side rendering will happen in a Deno-based edge function that’s deployed close to the site visitor. If set to false (the default), the site will deploy to Node-based Netlify Functions.

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-netlify';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			// will create a Netlify Edge Function using Deno-based
			// rather than using standard Node-based functions
			edge: true
		})
	}
};

export default config;
Netlify alternatives to SvelteKit functionality
You may build your app using functionality provided directly by SvelteKit without relying on any Netlify functionality. Using the SvelteKit versions of these features will allow them to be used in dev mode, tested with integration tests, and to work with other adapters should you ever decide to switch away from Netlify. However, in some scenarios you may find it beneficial to use the Netlify versions of these features. One example would be if you’re migrating an app that’s already hosted on Netlify to SvelteKit.

_headers and _redirects
The _headers and _redirects files specific to Netlify can be used for static asset responses (like images) by putting them into the project root folder.

Redirect rules
During compilation, redirect rules are automatically appended to your _redirects file. (If it doesn’t exist yet, it will be created.) That means:

[[redirects]] in netlify.toml will never match as _redirects has a higher priority. So always put your rules in the _redirects file.
_redirects shouldn’t have any custom “catch all” rules such as /* /foobar/:splat. Otherwise the automatically appended rule will never be applied as Netlify is only processing the first matching rule.
Netlify Forms
Create your Netlify HTML form as described here, e.g. as /routes/contact/+page.svelte. (Don’t forget to add the hidden form-name input element!)
Netlify’s build bot parses your HTML files at deploy time, which means your form must be prerendered as HTML. You can either add export const prerender = true to your contact.svelte to prerender just that page or set the kit.prerender.force: true option to prerender all pages.
If your Netlify form has a custom success message like <form netlify ... action="/success"> then ensure the corresponding /routes/success/+page.svelte exists and is prerendered.
Netlify Functions
With this adapter, SvelteKit endpoints are hosted as Netlify Functions. Netlify function handlers have additional context, including Netlify Identity information. You can access this context via the event.platform.context field inside your hooks and +page.server or +layout.server endpoints. These are serverless functions when the edge property is false in the adapter config or edge functions when it is true.

+page.server

import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async (event) => {
	const context = event.platform?.context;
	console.log(context); // shows up in your functions log in the Netlify app
};
Additionally, you can add your own Netlify functions by creating a directory for them and adding the configuration to your netlify.toml file. For example:


[build]
	command = "npm run build"
	publish = "build"

[functions]
	directory = "functions"
Troubleshooting
Accessing the file system
You can’t use fs in edge deployments.

You can use it in serverless deployments, but it won’t work as expected, since files are not copied from your project into your deployment. Instead, use the read function from $app/server to access your files. It also works inside edge deployments by fetching the file from the deployed public assets location.

Alternatively, you can prerender the routes in question.

To control how your routes are deployed to Vercel as functions, you can specify deployment configuration, either through the option shown above or with export const config inside +server.js, +page(.server).js and +layout(.server).js files.

For example you could deploy one specific route as an individual serverless function, separate from the rest of your app:

about/+page

import type { Config } from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';

export const config: Config = {
	split: true
};
The following options apply to all functions:

runtime: 'edge', 'nodejs20.x' or 'nodejs22.x'. By default, the adapter will select the 'nodejs<version>.x' corresponding to the Node version your project is configured to use on the Vercel dashboard
This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, at which point all your functions will use whichever Node version is specified in the project configuration on Vercel

regions: an array of edge network regions (defaulting to ["iad1"] for serverless functions) or 'all' if runtime is edge (its default). Note that multiple regions for serverless functions are only supported on Enterprise plans
split: if true, causes a route to be deployed as an individual function. If split is set to true at the adapter level, all routes will be deployed as individual functions
Additionally, the following option applies to edge functions:

external: an array of dependencies that esbuild should treat as external when bundling functions. This should only be used to exclude optional dependencies that will not run outside Node
And the following option apply to serverless functions:

memory: the amount of memory available to the function. Defaults to 1024 Mb, and can be decreased to 128 Mb or increased in 64Mb increments up to 3008 Mb on Pro or Enterprise accounts
maxDuration: maximum execution duration of the function. Defaults to 10 seconds for Hobby accounts, 15 for Pro and 900 for Enterprise
isr: configuration Incremental Static Regeneration, described below
Configuration set in a layout applies to all the routes beneath that layout, unless overridden at a more granular level.

If your functions need to access data in a specific region, it’s recommended that they be deployed in the same region (or close to it) for optimal performance.

Image Optimization
You may set the images config to control how Vercel builds your images. See the image configuration reference for full details. As an example, you may set:

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter({
			images: {
				sizes: [640, 828, 1200, 1920, 3840],
				formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
				minimumCacheTTL: 300,
				domains: ['example-app.vercel.app'],
			}
		})
	}
};

export default config;
Incremental Static Regeneration
Vercel supports Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), which provides the performance and cost advantages of prerendered content with the flexibility of dynamically rendered content.

Use ISR only on routes where every visitor should see the same content (much like when you prerender). If there’s anything user-specific happening (like session cookies), they should happen on the client via JavaScript only to not leak sensitive information across visits

To add ISR to a route, include the isr property in your config object:


import { BYPASS_TOKEN } from '$env/static/private';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/adapter-vercel').Config} */
export const config = {
	isr: {
		expiration: 60,
		bypassToken: BYPASS_TOKEN,
		allowQuery: ['search']
	}
};
Using ISR on a route with export const prerender = true will have no effect, since the route is prerendered at build time

The expiration property is required; all others are optional. The properties are discussed in more detail below.

expiration
The expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset will be re-generated by invoking the Serverless Function. Setting the value to false means it will never expire. In that case, you likely want to define a bypass token to re-generate on demand.

bypassToken
A random token that can be provided in the URL to bypass the cached version of the asset, by requesting the asset with a __prerender_bypass=<token> cookie.

Making a GET or HEAD request with x-prerender-revalidate: <token> will force the asset to be re-validated.

Note that the BYPASS_TOKEN string must be at least 32 characters long. You could generate one using the JavaScript console like so:


crypto.randomUUID();
Set this string as an environment variable on Vercel by logging in and going to your project then Settings > Environment Variables. For “Key” put BYPASS_TOKEN and for “value” use the string generated above, then hit “Save”.

To get this key known about for local development, you can use the Vercel CLI by running the vercel env pull command locally like so:


vercel env pull .env.development.local
allowQuery
A list of valid query parameters that contribute to the cache key. Other parameters (such as utm tracking codes) will be ignored, ensuring that they do not result in content being re-generated unnecessarily. By default, query parameters are ignored.

Pages that are prerendered will ignore ISR configuration.

Environment variables
Vercel makes a set of deployment-specific environment variables available. Like other environment variables, these are accessible from $env/static/private and $env/dynamic/private (sometimes — more on that later), and inaccessible from their public counterparts. To access one of these variables from the client:

+layout.server

import { VERCEL_COMMIT_REF } from '$env/static/private';
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: LayoutServerLoad = () => {
	return {
		deploymentGitBranch: VERCEL_COMMIT_REF
	};
};
+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import type { LayoutProps } from './$types';

	let { data }: LayoutProps = $props();
</script>

<p>This staging environment was deployed from {data.deploymentGitBranch}.</p>
Since all of these variables are unchanged between build time and run time when building on Vercel, we recommend using $env/static/private — which will statically replace the variables, enabling optimisations like dead code elimination — rather than $env/dynamic/private.

Skew protection
When a new version of your app is deployed, assets belonging to the previous version may no longer be accessible. If a user is actively using your app when this happens, it can cause errors when they navigate — this is known as version skew. SvelteKit mitigates this by detecting errors resulting from version skew and causing a hard reload to get the latest version of the app, but this will cause any client-side state to be lost. (You can also proactively mitigate it by observing updated.current from $app/state, which tells clients when a new version has been deployed.)

Skew protection is a Vercel feature that routes client requests to their original deployment. When a user visits your app, a cookie is set with the deployment ID, and any subsequent requests will be routed to that deployment for as long as skew protection is active. When they reload the page, they will get the newest deployment. (updated.current is exempted from this behaviour, and so will continue to report new deployments.) To enable it, visit the Advanced section of your project settings on Vercel.

Cookie-based skew protection comes with one caveat: if a user has multiple versions of your app open in multiple tabs, requests from older versions will be routed to the newer one, meaning they will fall back to SvelteKit’s built-in skew protection.

Notes
Vercel functions
If you have Vercel functions contained in the api directory at the project’s root, any requests for /api/* will not be handled by SvelteKit. You should implement these as API routes in your SvelteKit app instead, unless you need to use a non-JavaScript language in which case you will need to ensure that you don’t have any /api/* routes in your SvelteKit app.

Node version
Projects created before a certain date may default to using an older Node version than what SvelteKit currently requires. You can change the Node version in your project settings.

Troubleshooting
Accessing the file system
You can’t use fs in edge functions.

You can use it in serverless functions, but it won’t work as expected, since files are not copied from your project into your deployment. Instead, use the read function from $app/server to access your files. It also works inside routes deployed as edge functions by fetching the file from the deployed public assets location.

Alternatively, you can prerender the routes in question.

Deployment protection
If using read in an edge function, SvelteKit will fetch the file in question from your deployment. If you are using Deployment Protection, you must also enable Protection Bypass for Automation so that the request does not result in a 401 Unauthorized response.

Writing adapters
On this page
Writing adapters
If an adapter for your preferred environment doesn’t yet exist, you can build your own. We recommend looking at the source for an adapter to a platform similar to yours and copying it as a starting point.

Adapter packages implement the following API, which creates an Adapter:


/** @param {AdapterSpecificOptions} options */
export default function (options) {
	/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Adapter} */
	const adapter = {
		name: 'adapter-package-name',
		async adapt(builder) {
			// adapter implementation
		},
		async emulate() {
			return {
				async platform({ config, prerender }) {
					// the returned object becomes `event.platform` during dev, build and
					// preview. Its shape is that of `App.Platform`
				}
			}
		},
		supports: {
			read: ({ config, route }) => {
				// Return `true` if the route with the given `config` can use `read`
				// from `$app/server` in production, return `false` if it can't.
				// Or throw a descriptive error describing how to configure the deployment
			},
			tracing: () => {
				// Return `true` if this adapter supports loading `tracing.server.js`.
				// Return `false if it can't, or throw a descriptive error.
			}
		}
	};

	return adapter;
}
Of these, name and adapt are required. emulate and supports are optional.

Within the adapt method, there are a number of things that an adapter should do:

Clear out the build directory
Write SvelteKit output with builder.writeClient, builder.writeServer, and builder.writePrerendered
Output code that:
Imports Server from ${builder.getServerDirectory()}/index.js
Instantiates the app with a manifest generated with builder.generateManifest({ relativePath })
Listens for requests from the platform, converts them to a standard Request if necessary, calls the server.respond(request, { getClientAddress }) function to generate a Response and responds with it
expose any platform-specific information to SvelteKit via the platform option passed to server.respond
Globally shims fetch to work on the target platform, if necessary. SvelteKit provides a @sveltejs/kit/node/polyfills helper for platforms that can use undici
Bundle the output to avoid needing to install dependencies on the target platform, if necessary
Put the user’s static files and the generated JS/CSS in the correct location for the target platform
Where possible, we recommend putting the adapter output under the build/ directory with any intermediate output placed under .svelte-kit/[adapter-name].

Rest parameters
If the number of route segments is unknown, you can use rest syntax — for example you might implement GitHub’s file viewer like so...


/[org]/[repo]/tree/[branch]/[...file]
...in which case a request for /sveltejs/kit/tree/main/documentation/docs/04-advanced-routing.md would result in the following parameters being available to the page:


{
	org: 'sveltejs',
	repo: 'kit',
	branch: 'main',
	file: 'documentation/docs/04-advanced-routing.md'
}
src/routes/a/[...rest]/z/+page.svelte will match /a/z (i.e. there’s no parameter at all) as well as /a/b/z and /a/b/c/z and so on. Make sure you check that the value of the rest parameter is valid, for example using a matcher.

404 pages
Rest parameters also allow you to render custom 404s. Given these routes...


src/routes/
├ marx-brothers/
│ ├ chico/
│ ├ harpo/
│ ├ groucho/
│ └ +error.svelte
└ +error.svelte
...the marx-brothers/+error.svelte file will not be rendered if you visit /marx-brothers/karl, because no route was matched. If you want to render the nested error page, you should create a route that matches any /marx-brothers/* request, and return a 404 from it:


src/routes/
├ marx-brothers/
| ├ [...path]/
│ ├ chico/
│ ├ harpo/
│ ├ groucho/
│ └ +error.svelte
└ +error.svelte
src/routes/marx-brothers/[...path]/+page

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = (event) => {
	error(404, 'Not Found');
};
If you don’t handle 404 cases, they will appear in handleError

Optional parameters
A route like [lang]/home contains a parameter named lang which is required. Sometimes it’s beneficial to make these parameters optional, so that in this example both home and en/home point to the same page. You can do that by wrapping the parameter in another bracket pair: [[lang]]/home

Note that an optional route parameter cannot follow a rest parameter ([...rest]/[[optional]]), since parameters are matched ‘greedily’ and the optional parameter would always be unused.

Matching
A route like src/routes/fruits/[page] would match /fruits/apple, but it would also match /fruits/rocketship. We don’t want that. You can ensure that route parameters are well-formed by adding a matcher — which takes the parameter string ("apple" or "rocketship") and returns true if it is valid — to your params directory...

src/params/fruit

import type { ParamMatcher } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const match = ((param: string): param is ('apple' | 'orange') => {
	return param === 'apple' || param === 'orange';
}) satisfies ParamMatcher;
...and augmenting your routes:

src/routes/fruits/[page=fruit]
If the pathname doesn’t match, SvelteKit will try to match other routes (using the sort order specified below), before eventually returning a 404.

Each module in the params directory corresponds to a matcher, with the exception of *.test.js and *.spec.js files which may be used to unit test your matchers.

Matchers run both on the server and in the browser.

Sorting
It’s possible for multiple routes to match a given path. For example each of these routes would match /foo-abc:


src/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[[a=x]]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[b]/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte
SvelteKit needs to know which route is being requested. To do so, it sorts them according to the following rules...

More specific routes are higher priority (e.g. a route with no parameters is more specific than a route with one dynamic parameter, and so on)
Parameters with matchers ([name=type]) are higher priority than those without ([name])
[[optional]] and [...rest] parameters are ignored unless they are the final part of the route, in which case they are treated with lowest priority. In other words x/[[y]]/z is treated equivalently to x/z for the purposes of sorting
Ties are resolved alphabetically
...resulting in this ordering, meaning that /foo-abc will invoke src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte, and /foo-def will invoke src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte rather than less specific routes:


src/routes/foo-abc/+page.svelte
src/routes/foo-[c]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[[a=x]]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[b]/+page.svelte
src/routes/[...catchall]/+page.svelte
Encoding
Some characters can’t be used on the filesystem — / on Linux and Mac, \ / : * ? " < > | on Windows. The # and % characters have special meaning in URLs, and the [ ] ( ) characters have special meaning to SvelteKit, so these also can’t be used directly as part of your route.

To use these characters in your routes, you can use hexadecimal escape sequences, which have the format [x+nn] where nn is a hexadecimal character code:

\ — [x+5c]
/ — [x+2f]
: — [x+3a]
* — [x+2a]
? — [x+3f]
" — [x+22]
< — [x+3c]
> — [x+3e]
| — [x+7c]
# — [x+23]
% — [x+25]
[ — [x+5b]
] — [x+5d]
( — [x+28]
) — [x+29]
For example, to create a /smileys/:-) route, you would create a src/routes/smileys/[x+3a]-[x+29]/+page.svelte file.

You can determine the hexadecimal code for a character with JavaScript:


':'.charCodeAt(0).toString(16); // '3a', hence '[x+3a]'
You can also use Unicode escape sequences. Generally you won’t need to as you can use the unencoded character directly, but if — for some reason — you can’t have a filename with an emoji in it, for example, then you can use the escaped characters. In other words, these are equivalent:

src/routes/[u+d83e][u+dd2a]/+page.svelte
src/routes/🤪/+page.svelte
The format for a Unicode escape sequence is [u+nnnn] where nnnn is a valid value between 0000 and 10ffff. (Unlike JavaScript string escaping, there’s no need to use surrogate pairs to represent code points above ffff.) To learn more about Unicode encodings, consult Programming with Unicode.

Since TypeScript struggles with directories with a leading . character, you may find it useful to encode these characters when creating e.g. .well-known routes: src/routes/[x+2e]well-known/...

Advanced layouts
By default, the layout hierarchy mirrors the route hierarchy. In some cases, that might not be what you want.

(group)
Perhaps you have some routes that are ‘app’ routes that should have one layout (e.g. /dashboard or /item), and others that are ‘marketing’ routes that should have a different layout (/about or /testimonials). We can group these routes with a directory whose name is wrapped in parentheses — unlike normal directories, (app) and (marketing) do not affect the URL pathname of the routes inside them:


src/routes/
│ (app)/
│ ├ dashboard/
│ ├ item/
│ └ +layout.svelte
│ (marketing)/
│ ├ about/
│ ├ testimonials/
│ └ +layout.svelte
├ admin/
└ +layout.svelte
You can also put a +page directly inside a (group), for example if / should be an (app) or a (marketing) page.

Breaking out of layouts
The root layout applies to every page of your app — if omitted, it defaults to {@render children()}. If you want some pages to have a different layout hierarchy than the rest, then you can put your entire app inside one or more groups except the routes that should not inherit the common layouts.

In the example above, the /admin route does not inherit either the (app) or (marketing) layouts.

+page@
Pages can break out of the current layout hierarchy on a route-by-route basis. Suppose we have an /item/[id]/embed route inside the (app) group from the previous example:


src/routes/
├ (app)/
│ ├ item/
│ │ ├ [id]/
│ │ │ ├ embed/
│ │ │ │ └ +page.svelte
│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ └ +layout.svelte
└ +layout.svelte
Ordinarily, this would inherit the root layout, the (app) layout, the item layout and the [id] layout. We can reset to one of those layouts by appending @ followed by the segment name — or, for the root layout, the empty string. In this example, we can choose from the following options:

+page@[id].svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/item/[id]/+layout.svelte
+page@item.svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/item/+layout.svelte
+page@(app).svelte - inherits from src/routes/(app)/+layout.svelte
+page@.svelte - inherits from src/routes/+layout.svelte

src/routes/
├ (app)/
│ ├ item/
│ │ ├ [id]/
│ │ │ ├ embed/
│ │ │ │ └ +page@(app).svelte
│ │ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ │ └ +layout.svelte
│ └ +layout.svelte
└ +layout.svelte
+layout@
Like pages, layouts can themselves break out of their parent layout hierarchy, using the same technique. For example, a +layout@.svelte component would reset the hierarchy for all its child routes.

src/routes/
├ (app)/
│ ├ item/
│ │ ├ [id]/
│ │ │ ├ embed/
│ │ │ │ └ +page.svelte  // uses (app)/item/[id]/+layout.svelte
│ │ │ ├ +layout.svelte  // inherits from (app)/item/+layout@.svelte
│ │ │ └ +page.svelte    // uses (app)/item/+layout@.svelte
│ │ └ +layout@.svelte   // inherits from root layout, skipping (app)/+layout.svelte
│ └ +layout.svelte
└ +layout.svelte
When to use layout groups
Not all use cases are suited for layout grouping, nor should you feel compelled to use them. It might be that your use case would result in complex (group) nesting, or that you don’t want to introduce a (group) for a single outlier. It’s perfectly fine to use other means such as composition (reusable load functions or Svelte components) or if-statements to achieve what you want. The following example shows a layout that rewinds to the root layout and reuses components and functions that other layouts can also use:

src/routes/nested/route/+layout@

<script lang="ts">
	import ReusableLayout from '$lib/ReusableLayout.svelte';
	let { data, children } = $props();
</script>

<ReusableLayout {data}>
	{@render children()}
</ReusableLayout>
src/routes/nested/route/+layout

import { reusableLoad } from '$lib/reusable-load-function';
import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = (event) => {
	// Add additional logic here, if needed
	return reusableLoad(event);
};

Hooks
On this page
Hooks
Server hooks
Shared hooks
Universal hooks
Further reading
‘Hooks’ are app-wide functions you declare that SvelteKit will call in response to specific events, giving you fine-grained control over the framework’s behaviour.

There are three hooks files, all optional:

src/hooks.server.js — your app’s server hooks
src/hooks.client.js — your app’s client hooks
src/hooks.js — your app’s hooks that run on both the client and server
Code in these modules will run when the application starts up, making them useful for initializing database clients and so on.

You can configure the location of these files with config.kit.files.hooks.

Server hooks
The following hooks can be added to src/hooks.server.js:

handle
This function runs every time the SvelteKit server receives a request — whether that happens while the app is running, or during prerendering — and determines the response. It receives an event object representing the request and a function called resolve, which renders the route and generates a Response. This allows you to modify response headers or bodies, or bypass SvelteKit entirely (for implementing routes programmatically, for example).

src/hooks.server

import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	if (event.url.pathname.startsWith('/custom')) {
		return new Response('custom response');
	}

	const response = await resolve(event);
	return response;
};
Requests for static assets — which includes pages that were already prerendered — are not handled by SvelteKit.

If unimplemented, defaults to ({ event, resolve }) => resolve(event).

During prerendering, SvelteKit crawls your pages for links and renders each route it finds. Rendering the route invokes the handle function (and all other route dependencies, like load). If you need to exclude some code from running during this phase, check that the app is not building beforehand.

locals
To add custom data to the request, which is passed to handlers in +server.js and server load functions, populate the event.locals object, as shown below.

src/hooks.server

import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	event.locals.user = await getUserInformation(event.cookies.get('sessionid'));

	const response = await resolve(event);

	// Note that modifying response headers isn't always safe.
	// Response objects can have immutable headers
	// (e.g. Response.redirect() returned from an endpoint).
	// Modifying immutable headers throws a TypeError.
	// In that case, clone the response or avoid creating a
	// response object with immutable headers.
	response.headers.set('x-custom-header', 'potato');

	return response;
};
You can define multiple handle functions and execute them with the sequence helper function.

resolve also supports a second, optional parameter that gives you more control over how the response will be rendered. That parameter is an object that can have the following fields:

transformPageChunk(opts: { html: string, done: boolean }): MaybePromise<string | undefined> — applies custom transforms to HTML. If done is true, it’s the final chunk. Chunks are not guaranteed to be well-formed HTML (they could include an element’s opening tag but not its closing tag, for example) but they will always be split at sensible boundaries such as %sveltekit.head% or layout/page components.
filterSerializedResponseHeaders(name: string, value: string): boolean — determines which headers should be included in serialized responses when a load function loads a resource with fetch. By default, none will be included.
preload(input: { type: 'js' | 'css' | 'font' | 'asset', path: string }): boolean — determines what files should be added to the <head> tag to preload it. The method is called with each file that was found at build time while constructing the code chunks — so if you for example have import './styles.css in your +page.svelte, preload will be called with the resolved path to that CSS file when visiting that page. Note that in dev mode preload is not called, since it depends on analysis that happens at build time. Preloading can improve performance by downloading assets sooner, but it can also hurt if too much is downloaded unnecessarily. By default, js and css files will be preloaded. asset files are not preloaded at all currently, but we may add this later after evaluating feedback.
src/hooks.server

import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	const response = await resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('old', 'new'),
		filterSerializedResponseHeaders: (name) => name.startsWith('x-'),
		preload: ({ type, path }) => type === 'js' || path.includes('/important/')
	});

	return response;
};
Note that resolve(...) will never throw an error, it will always return a Promise<Response> with the appropriate status code. If an error is thrown elsewhere during handle, it is treated as fatal, and SvelteKit will respond with a JSON representation of the error or a fallback error page — which can be customised via src/error.html — depending on the Accept header. You can read more about error handling here.

handleFetch
This function allows you to modify (or replace) the result of an event.fetch call that runs on the server (or during prerendering) inside an endpoint, load, action, handle, handleError or reroute.

For example, your load function might make a request to a public URL like https://api.yourapp.com when the user performs a client-side navigation to the respective page, but during SSR it might make sense to hit the API directly (bypassing whatever proxies and load balancers sit between it and the public internet).

src/hooks.server

import type { HandleFetch } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handleFetch: HandleFetch = async ({ request, fetch }) => {
	if (request.url.startsWith('https://api.yourapp.com/')) {
		// clone the original request, but change the URL
		request = new Request(
			request.url.replace('https://api.yourapp.com/', 'http://localhost:9999/'),
			request
		);
	}

	return fetch(request);
};
Requests made with event.fetch follow the browser’s credentials model — for same-origin requests, cookie and authorization headers are forwarded unless the credentials option is set to "omit". For cross-origin requests, cookie will be included if the request URL belongs to a subdomain of the app — for example if your app is on my-domain.com, and your API is on api.my-domain.com, cookies will be included in the request.

There is one caveat: if your app and your API are on sibling subdomains — www.my-domain.com and api.my-domain.com for example — then a cookie belonging to a common parent domain like my-domain.com will not be included, because SvelteKit has no way to know which domain the cookie belongs to. In these cases you will need to manually include the cookie using handleFetch:

src/hooks.server

import type { HandleFetch } from '@sveltejs/kit';
export const handleFetch: HandleFetch = async ({ event, request, fetch }) => {
	if (request.url.startsWith('https://api.my-domain.com/')) {
		request.headers.set('cookie', event.request.headers.get('cookie'));
	}

	return fetch(request);
};
handleValidationError
This hook is called when a remote function is called with an argument that does not match the provided Standard Schema. It must return an object matching the shape of App.Error.

Say you have a remote function that expects a string as its argument ...

todos.remote

import * as v from 'valibot';
import { query } from '$app/server';

export const getTodo = query(v.string(), (id) => {
	// implementation...
});
...but it is called with something that doesn’t match the schema — such as a number (e.g await getTodos(1)) — then validation will fail, the server will respond with a 400 status code, and the function will throw with the message ‘Bad Request’.

To customise this message and add additional properties to the error object, implement handleValidationError:

src/hooks.server

import type { HandleValidationError } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handleValidationError: HandleValidationError = ({ issues }) => {
	return {
		message: 'No thank you'
	};
};
Be thoughtful about what information you expose here, as the most likely reason for validation to fail is that someone is sending malicious requests to your server.

Shared hooks
The following can be added to src/hooks.server.js and src/hooks.client.js:

handleError
If an unexpected error is thrown during loading, rendering, or from an endpoint, this function will be called with the error, event, status code and message. This allows for two things:

you can log the error
you can generate a custom representation of the error that is safe to show to users, omitting sensitive details like messages and stack traces. The returned value, which defaults to { message }, becomes the value of $page.error.
For errors thrown from your code (or library code called by your code) the status will be 500 and the message will be “Internal Error”. While error.message may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed to users, message is safe (albeit meaningless to the average user).

To add more information to the $page.error object in a type-safe way, you can customize the expected shape by declaring an App.Error interface (which must include message: string, to guarantee sensible fallback behavior). This allows you to — for example — append a tracking ID for users to quote in correspondence with your technical support staff:

src/app.d

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Error {
			message: string;
			errorId: string;
		}
	}
}

export {};
src/hooks.server

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';
import type { HandleServerError } from '@sveltejs/kit';

Sentry.init({/*...*/})

export const handleError: HandleServerError = async ({ error, event, status, message }) => {
	const errorId = crypto.randomUUID();

	// example integration with https://sentry.io/
	Sentry.captureException(error, {
		extra: { event, errorId, status }
	});

	return {
		message: 'Whoops!',
		errorId
	};
};
src/hooks.client

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';
import type { HandleClientError } from '@sveltejs/kit';

Sentry.init({/*...*/})

export const handleError: HandleClientError = async ({ error, event, status, message }) => {
	const errorId = crypto.randomUUID();

	// example integration with https://sentry.io/
	Sentry.captureException(error, {
		extra: { event, errorId, status }
	});

	return {
		message: 'Whoops!',
		errorId
	};
};
In src/hooks.client.js, the type of handleError is HandleClientError instead of HandleServerError, and event is a NavigationEvent rather than a RequestEvent.

This function is not called for expected errors (those thrown with the error function imported from @sveltejs/kit).

During development, if an error occurs because of a syntax error in your Svelte code, the passed in error has a frame property appended highlighting the location of the error.

Make sure that handleError never throws an error

init
This function runs once, when the server is created or the app starts in the browser, and is a useful place to do asynchronous work such as initializing a database connection.

If your environment supports top-level await, the init function is really no different from writing your initialisation logic at the top level of the module, but some environments — most notably, Safari — don’t.

src/hooks.server

import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { ServerInit } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const init: ServerInit = async () => {
	await db.connect();
};
In the browser, asynchronous work in init will delay hydration, so be mindful of what you put in there.

Universal hooks
The following can be added to src/hooks.js. Universal hooks run on both server and client (not to be confused with shared hooks, which are environment-specific).

reroute
This function runs before handle and allows you to change how URLs are translated into routes. The returned pathname (which defaults to url.pathname) is used to select the route and its parameters.

For example, you might have a src/routes/[[lang]]/about/+page.svelte page, which should be accessible as /en/about or /de/ueber-uns or /fr/a-propos. You could implement this with reroute:

src/hooks

import type { Reroute } from '@sveltejs/kit';
const translated: Record<string, string> = {
	'/en/about': '/en/about',
	'/de/ueber-uns': '/de/about',
	'/fr/a-propos': '/fr/about',
};

export const reroute: Reroute = ({ url }) => {
	if (url.pathname in translated) {
		return translated[url.pathname];
	}
};
The lang parameter will be correctly derived from the returned pathname.

Using reroute will not change the contents of the browser’s address bar, or the value of event.url.

Since version 2.18, the reroute hook can be asynchronous, allowing it to (for example) fetch data from your backend to decide where to reroute to. Use this carefully and make sure it’s fast, as it will delay navigation otherwise. If you need to fetch data, use the fetch provided as an argument. It has the same benefits as the fetch provided to load functions, with the caveat that params and id are unavailable to handleFetch because the route is not yet known.

src/hooks

import type { Reroute } from '@sveltejs/kit';
export const reroute: Reroute = async ({ url, fetch }) => {
	// Ask a special endpoint within your app about the destination
	if (url.pathname === '/api/reroute') return;

	const api = new URL('/api/reroute', url);
	api.searchParams.set('pathname', url.pathname);

	const result = await fetch(api).then(r => r.json());
	return result.pathname;
};
reroute is considered a pure, idempotent function. As such, it must always return the same output for the same input and not have side effects. Under these assumptions, SvelteKit caches the result of reroute on the client so it is only called once per unique URL.

transport
This is a collection of transporters, which allow you to pass custom types — returned from load and form actions — across the server/client boundary. Each transporter contains an encode function, which encodes values on the server (or returns a falsy value for anything that isn’t an instance of the type) and a corresponding decode function:

src/hooks

import { Vector } from '$lib/math';
import type { Transport } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const transport: Transport = {
	Vector: {
		encode: (value) => value instanceof Vector && [value.x, value.y],
		decode: ([x, y]) => new Vector(x, y)
	}
};

Errors
Error objects
Expected errors

Type safety
Further reading
Errors are an inevitable fact of software development. SvelteKit handles errors differently depending on where they occur, what kind of errors they are, and the nature of the incoming request.

Error objects
SvelteKit distinguishes between expected and unexpected errors, both of which are represented as simple { message: string } objects by default.

You can add additional properties, like a code or a tracking id, as shown in the examples below. (When using TypeScript this requires you to redefine the Error type as described in type safety).

Expected errors
An expected error is one created with the error helper imported from @sveltejs/kit:

src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server

import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import * as db from '$lib/server/database';
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ params }) => {
	const post = await db.getPost(params.slug);

	if (!post) {
		error(404, {
			message: 'Not found'
		});
	}

	return { post };
};
This throws an exception that SvelteKit catches, causing it to set the response status code to 404 and render an +error.svelte component, where page.error is the object provided as the second argument to error(...).

src/routes/+error

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

<h1>{page.error.message}</h1>
$app/state was added in SvelteKit 2.12. If you’re using an earlier version or are using Svelte 4, use $app/stores instead.

You can add extra properties to the error object if needed...


error(404, {
	message: 'Not found',
	code: 'NOT_FOUND'
});
...otherwise, for convenience, you can pass a string as the second argument:


error(404, { message: 'Not found' });
error(404, 'Not found');
In SvelteKit 1.x you had to throw the error yourself

Unexpected errors
An unexpected error is any other exception that occurs while handling a request. Since these can contain sensitive information, unexpected error messages and stack traces are not exposed to users.

By default, unexpected errors are printed to the console (or, in production, your server logs), while the error that is exposed to the user has a generic shape:


{ "message": "Internal Error" }
Unexpected errors will go through the handleError hook, where you can add your own error handling — for example, sending errors to a reporting service, or returning a custom error object which becomes $page.error.

Responses
If an error occurs inside handle or inside a +server.js request handler, SvelteKit will respond with either a fallback error page or a JSON representation of the error object, depending on the request’s Accept headers.

You can customise the fallback error page by adding a src/error.html file:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>%sveltekit.error.message%</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My custom error page</h1>
		<p>Status: %sveltekit.status%</p>
		<p>Message: %sveltekit.error.message%</p>
	</body>
</html>
SvelteKit will replace %sveltekit.status% and %sveltekit.error.message% with their corresponding values.

If the error instead occurs inside a load function while rendering a page, SvelteKit will render the +error.svelte component nearest to where the error occurred. If the error occurs inside a load function in +layout(.server).js, the closest error boundary in the tree is an +error.svelte file above that layout (not next to it).

The exception is when the error occurs inside the root +layout.js or +layout.server.js, since the root layout would ordinarily contain the +error.svelte component. In this case, SvelteKit uses the fallback error page.

Type safety
If you’re using TypeScript and need to customize the shape of errors, you can do so by declaring an App.Error interface in your app (by convention, in src/app.d.ts, though it can live anywhere that TypeScript can ‘see’):

src/app.d

declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Error {
			code: string;
			id: string;
		}
	}
}

export {};
This interface always includes a message: string property.

Link options
On this page
Link options
data-sveltekit-preload-data
data-sveltekit-preload-code
data-sveltekit-reload
data-sveltekit-replacestate
data-sveltekit-keepfocus
data-sveltekit-noscroll
Disabling options
In SvelteKit, <a> elements (rather than framework-specific <Link> components) are used to navigate between the routes of your app. If the user clicks on a link whose href is ‘owned’ by the app (as opposed to, say, a link to an external site) then SvelteKit will navigate to the new page by importing its code and then calling any load functions it needs to fetch data.

You can customise the behaviour of links with data-sveltekit-* attributes. These can be applied to the <a> itself, or to a parent element.

These options also apply to <form> elements with method="GET".

data-sveltekit-preload-data
Before the browser registers that the user has clicked on a link, we can detect that they’ve hovered the mouse over it (on desktop) or that a touchstart or mousedown event was triggered. In both cases, we can make an educated guess that a click event is coming.

SvelteKit can use this information to get a head start on importing the code and fetching the page’s data, which can give us an extra couple of hundred milliseconds — the difference between a user interface that feels laggy and one that feels snappy.

We can control this behaviour with the data-sveltekit-preload-data attribute, which can have one of two values:

"hover" means that preloading will start if the mouse comes to a rest over a link. On mobile, preloading begins on touchstart
"tap" means that preloading will start as soon as a touchstart or mousedown event is registered
The default project template has a data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover" attribute applied to the <body> element in src/app.html, meaning that every link is preloaded on hover by default:


<body data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover">
	<div style="display: contents">%sveltekit.body%</div>
</body>
Sometimes, calling load when the user hovers over a link might be undesirable, either because it’s likely to result in false positives (a click needn’t follow a hover) or because data is updating very quickly and a delay could mean staleness.

In these cases, you can specify the "tap" value, which causes SvelteKit to call load only when the user taps or clicks on a link:


<a data-sveltekit-preload-data="tap" href="/stonks">
	Get current stonk values
</a>
You can also programmatically invoke preloadData from $app/navigation.

Data will never be preloaded if the user has chosen reduced data usage, meaning navigator.connection.saveData is true.

data-sveltekit-preload-code
Even in cases where you don’t want to preload data for a link, it can be beneficial to preload the code. The data-sveltekit-preload-code attribute works similarly to data-sveltekit-preload-data, except that it can take one of four values, in decreasing ‘eagerness’:

"eager" means that links will be preloaded straight away
"viewport" means that links will be preloaded once they enter the viewport
"hover" - as above, except that only code is preloaded
"tap" - as above, except that only code is preloaded
Note that viewport and eager only apply to links that are present in the DOM immediately following navigation — if a link is added later (in an {#if ...} block, for example) it will not be preloaded until triggered by hover or tap. This is to avoid performance pitfalls resulting from aggressively observing the DOM for changes.

Since preloading code is a prerequisite for preloading data, this attribute will only have an effect if it specifies a more eager value than any data-sveltekit-preload-data attribute that is present.

As with data-sveltekit-preload-data, this attribute will be ignored if the user has chosen reduced data usage.

data-sveltekit-reload
Occasionally, we need to tell SvelteKit not to handle a link, but allow the browser to handle it. Adding a data-sveltekit-reload attribute to a link...


<a data-sveltekit-reload href="/path">Path</a>
...will cause a full-page navigation when the link is clicked.

Links with a rel="external" attribute will receive the same treatment. In addition, they will be ignored during prerendering.

data-sveltekit-replacestate
Sometimes you don’t want navigation to create a new entry in the browser’s session history. Adding a data-sveltekit-replacestate attribute to a link...


<a data-sveltekit-replacestate href="/path">Path</a>
...will replace the current history entry rather than creating a new one with pushState when the link is clicked.

data-sveltekit-keepfocus
Sometimes you don’t want focus to be reset after navigation. For example, maybe you have a search form that submits as the user is typing, and you want to keep focus on the text input. Adding a data-sveltekit-keepfocus attribute to it...


<form data-sveltekit-keepfocus>
	<input type="text" name="query">
</form>
...will cause the currently focused element to retain focus after navigation. In general, avoid using this attribute on links, since the focused element would be the <a> tag (and not a previously focused element) and screen reader and other assistive technology users often expect focus to be moved after a navigation. You should also only use this attribute on elements that still exist after navigation. If the element no longer exists, the user’s focus will be lost, making for a confusing experience for assistive technology users.

data-sveltekit-noscroll
When navigating to internal links, SvelteKit mirrors the browser’s default navigation behaviour: it will change the scroll position to 0,0 so that the user is at the very top left of the page (unless the link includes a #hash, in which case it will scroll to the element with a matching ID).

In certain cases, you may wish to disable this behaviour. Adding a data-sveltekit-noscroll attribute to a link...


<a href="path" data-sveltekit-noscroll>Path</a>
...will prevent scrolling after the link is clicked.

Disabling options
To disable any of these options inside an element where they have been enabled, use the "false" value:


<div data-sveltekit-preload-data>
	<!-- these links will be preloaded -->
	<a href="/a">a</a>
	<a href="/b">b</a>
	<a href="/c">c</a>

	<div data-sveltekit-preload-data="false">
		<!-- these links will NOT be preloaded -->
		<a href="/d">d</a>
		<a href="/e">e</a>
		<a href="/f">f</a>
	</div>
</div>
To apply an attribute to an element conditionally, do this:


<div data-sveltekit-preload-data={condition ? 'hover' : false}>

Service workers

Service workers
Inside the service worker
During development
Other solutions
References
Service workers act as proxy servers that handle network requests inside your app. This makes it possible to make your app work offline, but even if you don’t need offline support (or can’t realistically implement it because of the type of app you’re building), it’s often worth using service workers to speed up navigation by precaching your built JS and CSS.

In SvelteKit, if you have a src/service-worker.js file (or src/service-worker/index.js) it will be bundled and automatically registered. You can change the location of your service worker if you need to.

You can disable automatic registration if you need to register the service worker with your own logic or use another solution. The default registration looks something like this:


if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
	addEventListener('load', function () {
		navigator.serviceWorker.register('./path/to/service-worker.js');
	});
}
Inside the service worker
Inside the service worker you have access to the $service-worker module, which provides you with the paths to all static assets, build files and prerendered pages. You’re also provided with an app version string, which you can use for creating a unique cache name, and the deployment’s base path. If your Vite config specifies define (used for global variable replacements), this will be applied to service workers as well as your server/client builds.

The following example caches the built app and any files in static eagerly, and caches all other requests as they happen. This would make each page work offline once visited.

src/service-worker

// Disables access to DOM typings like `HTMLElement` which are not available
// inside a service worker and instantiates the correct globals
/// <reference no-default-lib="true"/>
/// <reference lib="esnext" />
/// <reference lib="webworker" />

// Ensures that the `$service-worker` import has proper type definitions
/// <reference types="@sveltejs/kit" />

// Only necessary if you have an import from `$env/static/public`
/// <reference types="../.svelte-kit/ambient.d.ts" />

import { build, files, version } from '$service-worker';

// This gives `self` the correct types
const self = globalThis.self as unknown as ServiceWorkerGlobalScope;

// Create a unique cache name for this deployment
const CACHE = `cache-${version}`;

const ASSETS = [
	...build, // the app itself
	...files  // everything in `static`
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
	// Create a new cache and add all files to it
	async function addFilesToCache() {
		const cache = await caches.open(CACHE);
		await cache.addAll(ASSETS);
	}

	event.waitUntil(addFilesToCache());
});

self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
	// Remove previous cached data from disk
	async function deleteOldCaches() {
		for (const key of await caches.keys()) {
			if (key !== CACHE) await caches.delete(key);
		}
	}

	event.waitUntil(deleteOldCaches());
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
	// ignore POST requests etc
	if (event.request.method !== 'GET') return;

	async function respond() {
		const url = new URL(event.request.url);
		const cache = await caches.open(CACHE);

		// `build`/`files` can always be served from the cache
		if (ASSETS.includes(url.pathname)) {
			const response = await cache.match(url.pathname);

			if (response) {
				return response;
			}
		}

		// for everything else, try the network first, but
		// fall back to the cache if we're offline
		try {
			const response = await fetch(event.request);

			// if we're offline, fetch can return a value that is not a Response
			// instead of throwing - and we can't pass this non-Response to respondWith
			if (!(response instanceof Response)) {
				throw new Error('invalid response from fetch');
			}

			if (response.status === 200) {
				cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
			}

			return response;
		} catch (err) {
			const response = await cache.match(event.request);

			if (response) {
				return response;
			}

			// if there's no cache, then just error out
			// as there is nothing we can do to respond to this request
			throw err;
		}
	}

	event.respondWith(respond());
});
Be careful when caching! In some cases, stale data might be worse than data that’s unavailable while offline. Since browsers will empty caches if they get too full, you should also be careful about caching large assets like video files.

During development
The service worker is bundled for production, but not during development. For that reason, only browsers that support modules in service workers will be able to use them at dev time. If you are manually registering your service worker, you will need to pass the { type: 'module' } option in development:


import { dev } from '$app/environment';

navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {
	type: dev ? 'module' : 'classic'
});
build and prerendered are empty arrays during development

Other solutions
SvelteKit’s service worker implementation is designed to be easy to work with and is probably a good solution for most users. However, outside of SvelteKit, many PWA applications leverage the Workbox library. If you’re used to using Workbox you may prefer Vite PWA plugin.

Server-only modules

Server-only modules
Private environment variables
Server-only utilities
Your modules
How it works
Further reading
Like a good friend, SvelteKit keeps your secrets. When writing your backend and frontend in the same repository, it can be easy to accidentally import sensitive data into your front-end code (environment variables containing API keys, for example). SvelteKit provides a way to prevent this entirely: server-only modules.

Private environment variables
The $env/static/private and $env/dynamic/private modules can only be imported into modules that only run on the server, such as hooks.server.js or +page.server.js.

Server-only utilities
The $app/server module, which contains a read function for reading assets from the filesystem, can likewise only be imported by code that runs on the server.

Your modules
You can make your own modules server-only in two ways:

adding .server to the filename, e.g. secrets.server.js
placing them in $lib/server, e.g. $lib/server/secrets.js
How it works
Any time you have public-facing code that imports server-only code (whether directly or indirectly)...

$lib/server/secrets

export const atlantisCoordinates = [/* redacted */];
src/routes/utils

export { atlantisCoordinates } from '$lib/server/secrets.js';

export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

src/routes/+page

<script>
	import { add } from './utils.js';
</script>
...SvelteKit will error:

Cannot import $lib/server/secrets.ts into code that runs in the browser, as this could leak sensitive information.

 src/routes/+page.svelte imports
  src/routes/utils.js imports
   $lib/server/secrets.ts

If you're only using the import as a type, change it to `import type`.
Even though the public-facing code — src/routes/+page.svelte — only uses the add export and not the secret atlantisCoordinates export, the secret code could end up in JavaScript that the browser downloads, and so the import chain is considered unsafe.

This feature also works with dynamic imports, even interpolated ones like await import(`./${foo}.js`).

Unit testing frameworks like Vitest do not distinguish between server-only and public-facing code. For this reason, illegal import detection is disabled when running tests, as determined by process.env.TEST === 'true'.

Snapshots
On this page
Snapshots
Ephemeral DOM state — like scroll positions on sidebars, the content of <input> elements and so on — is discarded when you navigate from one page to another.

For example, if the user fills out a form but navigates away and then back before submitting, or if the user refreshes the page, the values they filled in will be lost. In cases where it’s valuable to preserve that input, you can take a snapshot of DOM state, which can then be restored if the user navigates back.

To do this, export a snapshot object with capture and restore methods from a +page.svelte or +layout.svelte:

+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { Snapshot } from './$types';

	let comment = $state('');

	export const snapshot: Snapshot<string> = {
		capture: () => comment,
		restore: (value) => comment = value
	};
</script>

<form method="POST">
	<label for="comment">Comment</label>
	<textarea id="comment" bind:value={comment} />
	<button>Post comment</button>
</form>
When you navigate away from this page, the capture function is called immediately before the page updates, and the returned value is associated with the current entry in the browser’s history stack. If you navigate back, the restore function is called with the stored value as soon as the page is updated.

The data must be serializable as JSON so that it can be persisted to sessionStorage. This allows the state to be restored when the page is reloaded, or when the user navigates back from a different site.

Avoid returning very large objects from capture — once captured, objects will be retained in memory for the duration of the session, and in extreme cases may be too large to persist to sessionStorage.

Shallow routing

Shallow routing
API
Loading data for a route
Caveats
As you navigate around a SvelteKit app, you create history entries. Clicking the back and forward buttons traverses through this list of entries, re-running any load functions and replacing page components as necessary.

Sometimes, it’s useful to create history entries without navigating. For example, you might want to show a modal dialog that the user can dismiss by navigating back. This is particularly valuable on mobile devices, where swipe gestures are often more natural than interacting directly with the UI. In these cases, a modal that is not associated with a history entry can be a source of frustration, as a user may swipe backwards in an attempt to dismiss it and find themselves on the wrong page.

SvelteKit makes this possible with the pushState and replaceState functions, which allow you to associate state with a history entry without navigating. For example, to implement a history-driven modal:

+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { pushState } from '$app/navigation';
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	import Modal from './Modal.svelte';

	function showModal() {
		pushState('', {
			showModal: true
		});
	}
</script>

{#if page.state.showModal}
	<Modal close={() => history.back()} />
{/if}
The modal can be dismissed by navigating back (unsetting page.state.showModal) or by interacting with it in a way that causes the close callback to run, which will navigate back programmatically.

API
The first argument to pushState is the URL, relative to the current URL. To stay on the current URL, use ''.

The second argument is the new page state, which can be accessed via the page object as page.state. You can make page state type-safe by declaring an App.PageState interface (usually in src/app.d.ts).

To set page state without creating a new history entry, use replaceState instead of pushState.

page.state from $app/state was added in SvelteKit 2.12. If you’re using an earlier version or are using Svelte 4, use $page.state from $app/stores instead.

Loading data for a route
When shallow routing, you may want to render another +page.svelte inside the current page. For example, clicking on a photo thumbnail could pop up the detail view without navigating to the photo page.

For this to work, you need to load the data that the +page.svelte expects. A convenient way to do this is to use preloadData inside the click handler of an <a> element. If the element (or a parent) uses data-sveltekit-preload-data, the data will have already been requested, and preloadData will reuse that request.

src/routes/photos/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { preloadData, pushState, goto } from '$app/navigation';
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	import Modal from './Modal.svelte';
	import PhotoPage from './[id]/+page.svelte';

	let { data } = $props();
</script>

{#each data.thumbnails as thumbnail}
	<a
		href="/photos/{thumbnail.id}"
		onclick={async (e) => {
			if (innerWidth < 640        // bail if the screen is too small
				|| e.shiftKey             // or the link is opened in a new window
				|| e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey // or a new tab (mac: metaKey, win/linux: ctrlKey)
				// should also consider clicking with a mouse scroll wheel
			) return;

			// prevent navigation
			e.preventDefault();

			const { href } = e.currentTarget;

			// run `load` functions (or rather, get the result of the `load` functions
			// that are already running because of `data-sveltekit-preload-data`)
			const result = await preloadData(href);

			if (result.type === 'loaded' && result.status === 200) {

Caveats
During server-side rendering, page.state is always an empty object. The same is true for the first page the user lands on — if the user reloads the page (or returns from another document), state will not be applied until they navigate.

Shallow routing is a feature that requires JavaScript to work. Be mindful when using it and try to think of sensible fallback behavior in case JavaScript isn’t available.

Observability
Augmenting the built-in tracing
Development quickstart
@opentelemetry/api
Available since 2.31

Sometimes, you may need to observe how your application is behaving in order to improve performance or find the root cause of a pesky bug. To help with this, SvelteKit can emit server-side OpenTelemetry spans for the following:

The handle hook and handle functions running in a sequence (these will show up as children of each other and the root handle hook)
Server load functions and universal load functions when they’re run on the server
Form actions
Remote functions
Just telling SvelteKit to emit spans won’t get you far, though — you need to actually collect them somewhere to be able to view them. SvelteKit provides src/instrumentation.server.ts as a place to write your tracing setup and instrumentation code. It’s guaranteed to be run prior to your application code being imported, providing your deployment platform supports it and your adapter is aware of it.

Both of these features are currently experimental, meaning they are likely to contain bugs and are subject to change without notice. You must opt in by adding the kit.experimental.tracing.server and kit.experimental.instrumentation.server option in your svelte.config.js:

svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		experimental: {
			tracing: {
				server: true
			},
			instrumentation: {
				server: true
			}
		}
	}
};

export default config;
Tracing — and more significantly, observability instrumentation — can have a nontrivial overhead. Before you go all-in on tracing, consider whether or not you really need it, or if it might be more appropriate to turn it on in development and preview environments only.

Augmenting the built-in tracing
SvelteKit provides access to the root span and the current span on the request event. The root span is the one associated with your root handle function, and the current span could be associated with handle, load, a form action, or a remote function, depending on the context. You can annotate these spans with any attributes you wish to record:

$lib/authenticate

import { getRequestEvent } from '$app/server';
import { getAuthenticatedUser } from '$lib/auth-core';

async function authenticate() {
	const user = await getAuthenticatedUser();
	const event = getRequestEvent();
	event.tracing.root.setAttribute('userId', user.id);
}
Development quickstart
To view your first trace, you’ll need to set up a local collector. We’ll use Jaeger in this example, as they provide an easy-to-use quickstart command. Once your collector is running locally:

Turn on the experimental flags mentioned earlier in your svelte.config.js file
Use your package manager to install the dependencies you’ll need:

npm i @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto import-in-the-middle
Create src/instrumentation.server.js with the following:
src/instrumentation.server

import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node';
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from '@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node';
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto';
import { createAddHookMessageChannel } from 'import-in-the-middle';
import { register } from 'node:module';

const { registerOptions } = createAddHookMessageChannel();
register('import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs', import.meta.url, registerOptions);

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
	serviceName: 'test-sveltekit-tracing',
	traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter(),
	instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()]
});

sdk.start();
Now, server-side requests will begin generating traces, which you can view in Jaeger’s web console at localhost:16686.

@opentelemetry/api
SvelteKit uses @opentelemetry/api to generate its spans. This is declared as an optional peer dependency so that users not needing traces see no impact on install size or runtime performance. In most cases, if you’re configuring your application to collect SvelteKit’s spans, you’ll end up installing a library like @opentelemetry/sdk-node or @vercel/otel, which in turn depend on @opentelemetry/api, which will satisfy SvelteKit’s dependency as well. If you see an error from SvelteKit telling you it can’t find @opentelemetry/api, it may just be because you haven’t set up your trace collection yet. If you have done that and are still seeing the error, you can install @opentelemetry/api yourself.

Publishing
Caveats
You can use SvelteKit to build apps as well as component libraries, using the @sveltejs/package package (npx sv create has an option to set this up for you).

When you’re creating an app, the contents of src/routes is the public-facing stuff; src/lib contains your app’s internal library.

A component library has the exact same structure as a SvelteKit app, except that src/lib is the public-facing bit, and your root package.json is used to publish the package. src/routes might be a documentation or demo site that accompanies the library, or it might just be a sandbox you use during development.

Running the svelte-package command from @sveltejs/package will take the contents of src/lib and generate a dist directory (which can be configured) containing the following:

All the files in src/lib. Svelte components will be preprocessed, TypeScript files will be transpiled to JavaScript.
Type definitions (d.ts files) which are generated for Svelte, JavaScript and TypeScript files. You need to install typescript >= 4.0.0 for this. Type definitions are placed next to their implementation, hand-written d.ts files are copied over as is. You can disable generation, but we strongly recommend against it — people using your library might use TypeScript, for which they require these type definition files.
@sveltejs/package version 1 generated a package.json. This is no longer the case and it will now use the package.json from your project and validate that it is correct instead. If you’re still on version 1, see this PR for migration instructions.

Anatomy of a package.json
Since you’re now building a library for public use, the contents of your package.json will become more important. Through it, you configure the entry points of your package, which files are published to npm, and which dependencies your library has. Let’s go through the most important fields one by one.

name
This is the name of your package. It will be available for others to install using that name, and visible on https://npmjs.com/package/<name>.


{
	"name": "your-library"
}
Read more about it here.

license
Every package should have a license field so people know how they are allowed to use it. A very popular license which is also very permissive in terms of distribution and reuse without warranty is MIT.


{
	"license": "MIT"
}
Read more about it here. Note that you should also include a LICENSE file in your package.

files
This tells npm which files it will pack up and upload to npm. It should contain your output folder (dist by default). Your package.json and README and LICENSE will always be included, so you don’t need to specify them.


{
	"files": ["dist"]
}
To exclude unnecessary files (such as unit tests, or modules that are only imported from src/routes etc) you can add them to an .npmignore file. This will result in smaller packages that are faster to install.

Read more about it here.

exports
The "exports" field contains the package’s entry points. If you set up a new library project through npx sv create, it’s set to a single export, the package root:


{
	"exports": {
		".": {
			"types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/index.js"
		}
	}
}
This tells bundlers and tooling that your package only has one entry point, the root, and everything should be imported through that, like this:


import { Something } from 'your-library';
The types and svelte keys are export conditions. They tell tooling what file to import when they look up the your-library import:

TypeScript sees the types condition and looks up the type definition file. If you don’t publish type definitions, omit this condition.
Svelte-aware tooling sees the svelte condition and knows this is a Svelte component library. If you publish a library that does not export any Svelte components and that could also work in non-Svelte projects (for example a Svelte store library), you can replace this condition with default.
Previous versions of @sveltejs/package also added a package.json export. This is no longer part of the template because all tooling can now deal with a package.json not being explicitly exported.

You can adjust exports to your liking and provide more entry points. For example, if instead of a src/lib/index.js file that re-exported components you wanted to expose a src/lib/Foo.svelte component directly, you could create the following export map...


{
	"exports": {
		"./Foo.svelte": {
			"types": "./dist/Foo.svelte.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/Foo.svelte"
		}
	}
}
...and a consumer of your library could import the component like so:


import Foo from 'your-library/Foo.svelte';
Beware that doing this will need additional care if you provide type definitions. Read more about the caveat here

In general, each key of the exports map is the path the user will have to use to import something from your package, and the value is the path to the file that will be imported or a map of export conditions which in turn contains these file paths.

Read more about exports here.

svelte
This is a legacy field that enabled tooling to recognise Svelte component libraries. It’s no longer necessary when using the svelte export condition, but for backwards compatibility with outdated tooling that doesn’t yet know about export conditions it’s good to keep it around. It should point towards your root entry point.


{
	"svelte": "./dist/index.js"
}
sideEffects
The sideEffects field in package.json is used by bundlers to determine if a module may contain code that has side effects. A module is considered to have side effects if it makes changes that are observable from other scripts outside the module when it’s imported. For example, side effects include modifying global variables or the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. Because a side effect could potentially affect the behavior of other parts of the application, these files/modules will be included in the final bundle regardless of whether their exports are used in the application. It is a best practice to avoid side effects in your code.

Setting the sideEffects field in package.json can help the bundler to be more aggressive in eliminating unused exports from the final bundle, a process known as tree-shaking. This results in smaller and more efficient bundles. Different bundlers handle sideEffects in various manners. While not necessary for Vite, we recommend that libraries state that all CSS files have side effects so that your library will be compatible with webpack. This is the configuration that comes with newly created projects:

package

{
	"sideEffects": ["**/*.css"]
}
If the scripts in your library have side effects, ensure that you update the sideEffects field. All scripts are marked as side effect free by default in newly created projects. If a file with side effects is incorrectly marked as having no side effects, it can result in broken functionality.

If your package has files with side effects, you can specify them in an array:

package

{
	"sideEffects": [
		"**/*.css",
		"./dist/sideEffectfulFile.js"
	]
}
This will treat only the specified files as having side effects.

TypeScript
You should ship type definitions for your library even if you don’t use TypeScript yourself so that people who do get proper intellisense when using your library. @sveltejs/package makes the process of generating types mostly opaque to you. By default, when packaging your library, type definitions are auto-generated for JavaScript, TypeScript and Svelte files. All you need to ensure is that the types condition in the exports map points to the correct files. When initialising a library project through npx sv create, this is automatically setup for the root export.

If you have something else than a root export however — for example providing a your-library/foo import — you need to take additional care for providing type definitions. Unfortunately, TypeScript by default will not resolve the types condition for an export like { "./foo": { "types": "./dist/foo.d.ts", ... }}. Instead, it will search for a foo.d.ts relative to the root of your library (i.e. your-library/foo.d.ts instead of your-library/dist/foo.d.ts). To fix this, you have two options:

The first option is to require people using your library to set the moduleResolution option in their tsconfig.json (or jsconfig.json) to bundler (available since TypeScript 5, the best and recommended option in the future), node16 or nodenext. This opts TypeScript into actually looking at the exports map and resolving the types correctly.

The second option is to (ab)use the typesVersions feature from TypeScript to wire up the types. This is a field inside package.json TypeScript uses to check for different type definitions depending on the TypeScript version, and also contains a path mapping feature for that. We leverage that path mapping feature to get what we want. For the mentioned foo export above, the corresponding typesVersions looks like this:


{
	"exports": {
		"./foo": {
			"types": "./dist/foo.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/foo.js"
		}
	},
	"typesVersions": {
		">4.0": {
			"foo": ["./dist/foo.d.ts"]
		}
	}
}
>4.0 tells TypeScript to check the inner map if the used TypeScript version is greater than 4 (which should in practice always be true). The inner map tells TypeScript that the typings for your-library/foo are found within ./dist/foo.d.ts, which essentially replicates the exports condition. You also have * as a wildcard at your disposal to make many type definitions at once available without repeating yourself. Note that if you opt into typesVersions you have to declare all type imports through it, including the root import (which is defined as "index.d.ts": [..]).

You can read more about that feature here.

Best practices
You should avoid using SvelteKit-specific modules like $app/environment in your packages unless you intend for them to only be consumable by other SvelteKit projects. E.g. rather than using import { browser } from '$app/environment' you could use import { BROWSER } from 'esm-env' (see esm-env docs). You may also wish to pass in things like the current URL or a navigation action as a prop rather than relying directly on $app/state, $app/navigation, etc. Writing your app in this more generic fashion will also make it easier to setup tools for testing, UI demos and so on.

Ensure that you add aliases via svelte.config.js (not vite.config.js or tsconfig.json), so that they are processed by svelte-package.

You should think carefully about whether or not the changes you make to your package are a bug fix, a new feature, or a breaking change, and update the package version accordingly. Note that if you remove any paths from exports or any export conditions inside them from your existing library, that should be regarded as a breaking change.


{
	"exports": {
		".": {
			"types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
// changing `svelte` to `default` is a breaking change:
			"svelte": "./dist/index.js"
			"default": "./dist/index.js"
		},
// removing this is a breaking change:
		"./foo": {
			"types": "./dist/foo.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/foo.js",
			"default": "./dist/foo.js"
		},
// adding this is ok:
		"./bar": {
			"types": "./dist/bar.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/bar.js",
			"default": "./dist/bar.js"
		}
	}
}
Source maps
You can create so-called declaration maps (d.ts.map files) by setting "declarationMap": true in your tsconfig.json. This will allow editors such as VS Code to go to the original .ts or .svelte file when using features like Go to Definition. This means you also need to publish your source files alongside your dist folder in a way that the relative path inside the declaration files leads to a file on disk. Assuming that you have all your library code inside src/lib as suggested by Svelte’s CLI, this is as simple as adding src/lib to files in your package.json:


{
	"files": [
		"dist",
		"!dist/**/*.test.*",
		"!dist/**/*.spec.*",
		"src/lib",
		"!src/lib/**/*.test.*",
		"!src/lib/**/*.spec.*"
	]
}
Options
svelte-package accepts the following options:

-w / --watch — watch files in src/lib for changes and rebuild the package
-i / --input — the input directory which contains all the files of the package. Defaults to src/lib
-o / --output — the output directory where the processed files are written to. Your package.json’s exports should point to files inside there, and the files array should include that folder. Defaults to dist
-p / --preserve-output — prevent deletion of the output directory before packaging. Defaults to false, which means that the output directory will be emptied first
-t / --types — whether or not to create type definitions (d.ts files). We strongly recommend doing this as it fosters ecosystem library quality. Defaults to true
--tsconfig - the path to a tsconfig or jsconfig. When not provided, searches for the next upper tsconfig/jsconfig in the workspace path.
Publishing
To publish the generated package:


npm publish
Caveats
All relative file imports need to be fully specified, adhering to Node’s ESM algorithm. This means that for a file like src/lib/something/index.js, you must include the filename with the extension:


import { something } from './something/index.js';
If you are using TypeScript, you need to import .ts files the same way, but using a .js file ending, not a .ts file ending. (This is a TypeScript design decision outside our control.) Setting "moduleResolution": "NodeNext" in your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json will help you with this.

All files except Svelte files (preprocessed) and TypeScript files (transpiled to JavaScript) are copied across as-is.

Auth
On this page
Auth
Sessions vs tokens
Integration points
Guides
Auth refers to authentication and authorization, which are common needs when building a web application. Authentication means verifying that the user is who they say they are based on their provided credentials. Authorization means determining which actions they are allowed to take.

Sessions vs tokens
After the user has provided their credentials such as a username and password, we want to allow them to use the application without needing to provide their credentials again for future requests. Users are commonly authenticated on subsequent requests with either a session identifier or signed token such as a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Session IDs are most commonly stored in a database. They can be immediately revoked, but require a database query to be made on each request.

In contrast, JWT generally are not checked against a datastore, which means they cannot be immediately revoked. The advantage of this method is improved latency and reduced load on your datastore.

Integration points
Auth cookies can be checked inside server hooks. If a user is found matching the provided credentials, the user information can be stored in locals.

Guides
Lucia is a good reference for session-based web app auth. It contains example code snippets and projects for implementing session-based auth within SvelteKit and other JS projects. You can add code which follows the Lucia guide to your project with npx sv create when creating a new project or npx sv add lucia for an existing project.

An auth system is tightly coupled to a web framework because most of the code lies in validating user input, handling errors, and directing users to the appropriate next page. As a result, many of the generic JS auth libraries include one or more web frameworks within them. For this reason, many users will find it preferrable to follow a SvelteKit-specific guide such as the examples found in Lucia rather than having multiple web frameworks inside their project.

Further reading
Out of the box, SvelteKit does a lot of work to make your applications as performant as possible:

Code-splitting, so that only the code you need for the current page is loaded
Asset preloading, so that ‘waterfalls’ (of files requesting other files) are prevented
File hashing, so that your assets can be cached forever
Request coalescing, so that data fetched from separate server load functions is grouped into a single HTTP request
Parallel loading, so that separate universal load functions fetch data simultaneously
Data inlining, so that requests made with fetch during server rendering can be replayed in the browser without issuing a new request
Conservative invalidation, so that load functions are only re-run when necessary
Prerendering (configurable on a per-route basis, if necessary) so that pages without dynamic data can be served instantaneously
Link preloading, so that data and code requirements for a client-side navigation are eagerly anticipated
Nevertheless, we can’t (yet) eliminate all sources of slowness. To eke out maximum performance, you should be mindful of the following tips.

Diagnosing issues
Google’s PageSpeed Insights and (for more advanced analysis) WebPageTest are excellent ways to understand the performance characteristics of a site that is already deployed to the internet.

Your browser also includes useful developer tools for analysing your site, whether deployed or running locally:

Chrome - Lighthouse, Network, and Performance devtools
Edge - Lighthouse, Network, and Performance devtools
Firefox - Network and Performance devtools
Safari - enhancing the performance of your webpage
Note that your site running locally in dev mode will exhibit different behaviour than your production app, so you should do performance testing in preview mode after building.

Instrumenting
If you see in the network tab of your browser that an API call is taking a long time and you’d like to understand why, you may consider instrumenting your backend with a tool like OpenTelemetry or Server-Timing headers.

Optimizing assets
Images
Reducing the size of image files is often one of the most impactful changes you can make to a site’s performance. Svelte provides the @sveltejs/enhanced-img package, detailed on the images page, for making this easier. Additionally, Lighthouse is useful for identifying the worst offenders.

Videos
Video files can be very large, so extra care should be taken to ensure that they’re optimized:

Compress videos with tools such as Handbrake. Consider converting the videos to web-friendly formats such as .webm or .mp4.
You can lazy-load videos located below the fold with preload="none" (though note that this will slow down playback when the user does initiate it).
Strip the audio track out of muted videos using a tool like FFmpeg.
Fonts
SvelteKit automatically preloads critical .js and .css files when the user visits a page, but it does not preload fonts by default, since this may cause unnecessary files (such as font weights that are referenced by your CSS but not actually used on the current page) to be downloaded. Having said that, preloading fonts correctly can make a big difference to how fast your site feels. In your handle hook, you can call resolve with a preload filter that includes your fonts.

You can reduce the size of font files by subsetting your fonts.

Reducing code size
Svelte version
We recommend running the latest version of Svelte. Svelte 5 is smaller and faster than Svelte 4, which is smaller and faster than Svelte 3.

Packages
rollup-plugin-visualizer can be helpful for identifying which packages are contributing the most to the size of your site. You may also find opportunities to remove code by manually inspecting the build output (use build: { minify: false } in your Vite config to make the output readable, but remember to undo that before deploying your app), or via the network tab of your browser’s devtools.

External scripts
Try to minimize the number of third-party scripts running in the browser. For example, instead of using JavaScript-based analytics consider using server-side implementations, such as those offered by many platforms with SvelteKit adapters including Cloudflare, Netlify, and Vercel.

To run third party scripts in a web worker (which avoids blocking the main thread), use Partytown’s SvelteKit integration.

Selective loading
Code imported with static import declarations will be automatically bundled with the rest of your page. If there is a piece of code you need only when some condition is met, use the dynamic import(...) form to selectively lazy-load the component.

Navigation
Preloading
You can speed up client-side navigations by eagerly preloading the necessary code and data, using link options. This is configured by default on the <body> element when you create a new SvelteKit app.

Non-essential data
For slow-loading data that isn’t needed immediately, the object returned from your load function can contain promises rather than the data itself. For server load functions, this will cause the data to stream in after the navigation (or initial page load).

Preventing waterfalls
One of the biggest performance killers is what is referred to as a waterfall, which is a series of requests that is made sequentially. This can happen on the server or in the browser, but is especially costly when dealing with data that has to travel further or across slower networks, such as a mobile user making a call to a distant server.

In the browser, waterfalls can occur when your HTML kicks off request chains such as requesting JS which requests CSS which requests a background image and web font. SvelteKit will largely solve this class of problems for you by adding modulepreload tags or headers, but you should view the network tab in your devtools to check whether additional resources need to be preloaded.

Pay special attention to this if you use web fonts since they need to be handled manually.
Enabling single page app (SPA) mode will cause such waterfalls. With SPA mode, an empty page is generated, which fetches JavaScript, which ultimately loads and renders the page. This results in extra network round trips before a single pixel can be displayed.
Waterfalls can also occur on calls to the backend whether made from the browser or server. E.g. if a universal load function makes an API call to fetch the current user, then uses the details from that response to fetch a list of saved items, and then uses that response to fetch the details for each item, the browser will end up making multiple sequential requests. This is deadly for performance, especially for users that are physically located far from your backend.

Avoid this issue by using server load functions to make requests to backend services that are dependencies from the server rather than from the browser. Note, however, that server load functions are also not immune to waterfalls (though they are much less costly since they rarely involve round trips with high latency). For example, if you query a database to get the current user and then use that data to make a second query for a list of saved items, it will typically be more performant to issue a single query with a database join.
Hosting
Your frontend should be located in the same data center as your backend to minimize latency. For sites with no central backend, many SvelteKit adapters support deploying to the edge, which means handling each user’s requests from a nearby server. This can reduce load times significantly. Some adapters even support configuring deployment on a per-route basis. You should also consider serving images from a CDN (which are typically edge networks) — the hosts for many SvelteKit adapters will do this automatically.

Ensure your host uses HTTP/2 or newer. Vite’s code splitting creates numerous small files for improved cacheability, which results in excellent performance, but this does assume that your files can be loaded in parallel with HTTP/2.

Further reading
For the most part, building a performant SvelteKit app is the same as building any performant web app. You should be able to apply information from general performance resources such as Core Web Vitals to any web experience you build.

Icons
On this page
Icons
CSS
Svelte
CSS
A great way to use icons is to define them purely via CSS. Iconify offers support for many popular icon sets that can be included via CSS. This method can also be used with popular CSS frameworks by leveraging the Iconify Tailwind CSS plugin or UnoCSS plugin. As opposed to libraries based on Svelte components, it doesn’t require each icon to be imported into your .svelte file.

Svelte
There are many icon libraries for Svelte. When choosing an icon library, it is recommended to avoid those that provide a .svelte file per icon, as these libraries can have thousands of .svelte files which really slow down Vite’s dependency optimization. This can become especially pathological if the icons are imported both via an umbrella import and subpath import as described in the vite-plugin-svelte FAQ.

Images
Vite’s built-in handling
@sveltejs/enhanced-img
Loading images dynamically from a CDN
Best practices
Images can have a big impact on your app’s performance. For best results, you should optimize them by doing the following:

generate optimal formats like .avif and .webp
create different sizes for different screens
ensure that assets can be cached effectively
Doing this manually is tedious. There are a variety of techniques you can use, depending on your needs and preferences.

Vite’s built-in handling
Vite will automatically process imported assets for improved performance. This includes assets referenced via the CSS url() function. Hashes will be added to the filenames so that they can be cached, and assets smaller than assetsInlineLimit will be inlined. Vite’s asset handling is most often used for images, but is also useful for video, audio, etc.


<script>
	import logo from '$lib/assets/logo.png';
</script>

<img alt="The project logo" src={logo} />
@sveltejs/enhanced-img
@sveltejs/enhanced-img is a plugin offered on top of Vite’s built-in asset handling. It provides plug and play image processing that serves smaller file formats like avif or webp, automatically sets the intrinsic width and height of the image to avoid layout shift, creates images of multiple sizes for various devices, and strips EXIF data for privacy. It will work in any Vite-based project including, but not limited to, SvelteKit projects.

As a build plugin, @sveltejs/enhanced-img can only optimize files located on your machine during the build process. If you have an image located elsewhere (such as a path served from your database, CMS, or backend), please read about loading images dynamically from a CDN.

Setup
Install:


npm i -D @sveltejs/enhanced-img
Adjust vite.config.js:


import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { enhancedImages } from '@sveltejs/enhanced-img';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		enhancedImages(), // must come before the SvelteKit plugin
		sveltekit()
	]
});
Building will take longer on the first build due to the computational expense of transforming images. However, the build output will be cached in ./node_modules/.cache/imagetools so that subsequent builds will be fast.

Basic usage
Use in your .svelte components by using <enhanced:img> rather than <img> and referencing the image file with a Vite asset import path:


<enhanced:img src="./path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="An alt text" />
At build time, your <enhanced:img> tag will be replaced with an <img> wrapped by a <picture> providing multiple image types and sizes. It’s only possible to downscale images without losing quality, which means that you should provide the highest resolution image that you need — smaller versions will be generated for the various device types that may request an image.

You should provide your image at 2x resolution for HiDPI displays (a.k.a. retina displays). <enhanced:img> will automatically take care of serving smaller versions to smaller devices.

if you wish to use a tag name CSS selector in your <style> block you will need to write enhanced\:img to escape the colon in the tag name.

Dynamically choosing an image
You can also manually import an image asset and pass it to an <enhanced:img>. This is useful when you have a collection of static images and would like to dynamically choose one or iterate over them. In this case you will need to update both the import statement and <img> element as shown below to indicate you’d like process them.


<script>
	import MyImage from './path/to/your/image.jpg?enhanced';
</script>

<enhanced:img src={MyImage} alt="some alt text" />
You can also use Vite’s import.meta.glob. Note that you will have to specify enhanced via a custom query:


<script>
	const imageModules = import.meta.glob(
		'/path/to/assets/*.{avif,gif,heif,jpeg,jpg,png,tiff,webp}',
		{
			eager: true,
			query: {
				enhanced: true
			}
		}
	)
</script>

{#each Object.entries(imageModules) as [_path, module]}
	<enhanced:img src={module.default} alt="some alt text" />
{/each}
svg images are currently only supported statically

Intrinsic Dimensions
width and height are optional as they can be inferred from the source image and will be automatically added when the <enhanced:img> tag is preprocessed. With these attributes, the browser can reserve the correct amount of space, preventing layout shift. If you’d like to use a different width and height you can style the image with CSS. Because the preprocessor adds a width and height for you, if you’d like one of the dimensions to be automatically calculated then you will need to specify that:


<style>
	.hero-image img {
		width: var(--size);
		height: auto;
	}
</style>
srcset and sizes
If you have a large image, such as a hero image taking the width of the design, you should specify sizes so that smaller versions are requested on smaller devices. E.g. if you have a 1280px image you may want to specify something like:


<enhanced:img src="./image.png" sizes="min(1280px, 100vw)"/>
If sizes is specified, <enhanced:img> will generate small images for smaller devices and populate the srcset attribute.

The smallest picture generated automatically will have a width of 540px. If you’d like smaller images or would otherwise like to specify custom widths, you can do that with the w query parameter:


<enhanced:img
  src="./image.png?w=1280;640;400"
  sizes="(min-width:1920px) 1280px, (min-width:1080px) 640px, (min-width:768px) 400px"
/>
If sizes is not provided, then a HiDPI/Retina image and a standard resolution image will be generated. The image you provide should be 2x the resolution you wish to display so that the browser can display that image on devices with a high device pixel ratio.

Per-image transforms
By default, enhanced images will be transformed to more efficient formats. However, you may wish to apply other transforms such as a blur, quality, flatten, or rotate operation. You can run per-image transforms by appending a query string:


<enhanced:img src="./path/to/your/image.jpg?blur=15" alt="An alt text" />
See the imagetools repo for the full list of directives.

Loading images dynamically from a CDN
In some cases, the images may not be accessible at build time — e.g. they may live inside a content management system or elsewhere.

Using a content delivery network (CDN) can allow you to optimize these images dynamically, and provides more flexibility with regards to sizes, but it may involve some setup overhead and usage costs. Depending on caching strategy, the browser may not be able to use a cached copy of the asset until a 304 response is received from the CDN. Building HTML to target CDNs allows using an <img> tag since the CDN can serve the appropriate format based on the User-Agent header, whereas build-time optimizations must produce <picture> tags with multiple sources. Finally, some CDNs may generate images lazily, which could have a negative performance impact for sites with low traffic and frequently changing images.

CDNs can generally be used without any need for a library. However, there are a number of libraries with Svelte support that make it easier. @unpic/svelte is a CDN-agnostic library with support for a large number of providers. You may also find that specific CDNs like Cloudinary have Svelte support. Finally, some content management systems (CMS) which support Svelte (such as Contentful, Storyblok, and Contentstack) have built-in support for image handling.

Best practices
For each image type, use the appropriate solution from those discussed above. You can mix and match all three solutions in one project. For example, you may use Vite’s built-in handling to provide images for <meta> tags, display images on your homepage with @sveltejs/enhanced-img, and display user-submitted content with a dynamic approach.
Consider serving all images via CDN regardless of the image optimization types you use. CDNs reduce latency by distributing copies of static assets globally.
Your original images should have a good quality/resolution and should have 2x the width it will be displayed at to serve HiDPI devices. Image processing can size images down to save bandwidth when serving smaller screens, but it would be a waste of bandwidth to invent pixels to size images up.
For images which are much larger than the width of a mobile device (roughly 400px), such as a hero image taking the width of the page design, specify sizes so that smaller images can be served on smaller devices.
For important images, such as the largest contentful paint (LCP) image, set fetchpriority="high" and avoid loading="lazy" to prioritize loading as early as possible.
Give the image a container or styling so that it is constrained and does not jump around while the page is loading affecting your cumulative layout shift (CLS). width and height help the browser to reserve space while the image is still loading, so @sveltejs/enhanced-img will add a width and height for you.
Always provide a good alt text. The Svelte compiler will warn you if you don’t do this.
Do not use em or rem in sizes and change the default size of these measures. When used in sizes or @media queries, em and rem are both defined to mean the user’s default font-size. For a sizes declaration like sizes="(min-width: 768px) min(100vw, 108rem), 64rem", the actual em or rem that controls how the image is laid out on the page can be different if changed by CSS. For example, do not do something like html { font-size: 62.5%; } as the slot reserved by the browser preloader will now end up being larger than the actual slot of the CSS object model once it has been created.

Further reading
SvelteKit strives to provide an accessible platform for your app by default. Svelte’s compile-time accessibility checks will also apply to any SvelteKit application you build.

Here’s how SvelteKit’s built-in accessibility features work and what you need to do to help these features to work as well as possible. Keep in mind that while SvelteKit provides an accessible foundation, you are still responsible for making sure your application code is accessible. If you’re new to accessibility, see the “further reading” section of this guide for additional resources.

We recognize that accessibility can be hard to get right. If you want to suggest improvements to how SvelteKit handles accessibility, please open a GitHub issue.

Route announcements
In traditional server-rendered applications, every navigation (e.g. clicking on an <a> tag) triggers a full page reload. When this happens, screen readers and other assistive technology will read out the new page’s title so that users understand that the page has changed.

Since navigation between pages in SvelteKit happens without reloading the page (known as client-side routing), SvelteKit injects a live region onto the page that will read out the new page name after each navigation. This determines the page name to announce by inspecting the <title> element.

Because of this behavior, every page in your app should have a unique, descriptive title. In SvelteKit, you can do this by placing a <svelte:head> element on each page:

src/routes/+page

<svelte:head>
	<title>Todo List</title>
</svelte:head>
This will allow screen readers and other assistive technology to identify the new page after a navigation occurs. Providing a descriptive title is also important for SEO.

Focus management
In traditional server-rendered applications, every navigation will reset focus to the top of the page. This ensures that people browsing the web with a keyboard or screen reader will start interacting with the page from the beginning.

To simulate this behavior during client-side routing, SvelteKit focuses the <body> element after each navigation and enhanced form submission. There is one exception - if an element with the autofocus attribute is present, SvelteKit will focus that element instead. Make sure to consider the implications for assistive technology when using that attribute.

If you want to customize SvelteKit’s focus management, you can use the afterNavigate hook:


import { afterNavigate } from '$app/navigation';

afterNavigate(() => {
	/** @type {HTMLElement | null} */
	const to_focus = document.querySelector('.focus-me');
	to_focus?.focus();
});
You can also programmatically navigate to a different page using the goto function. By default, this will have the same client-side routing behavior as clicking on a link. However, goto also accepts a keepFocus option that will preserve the currently-focused element instead of resetting focus. If you enable this option, make sure the currently-focused element still exists on the page after navigation. If the element no longer exists, the user’s focus will be lost, making for a confusing experience for assistive technology users.

The “lang” attribute
By default, SvelteKit’s page template sets the default language of the document to English. If your content is not in English, you should update the <html> element in src/app.html to have the correct lang attribute. This will ensure that any assistive technology reading the document uses the correct pronunciation. For example, if your content is in German, you should update app.html to the following:

src/app

<html lang="de">
If your content is available in multiple languages, you should set the lang attribute based on the language of the current page. You can do this with SvelteKit’s handle hook:

src/app

<html lang="%lang%">
src/hooks.server

import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = ({ event, resolve }) => {
	return resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('%lang%', get_lang(event))
	});
};

SEO
Out of the box
Manual setup
The most important aspect of SEO is to create high-quality content that is widely linked to from around the web. However, there are a few technical considerations for building sites that rank well.

Out of the box
SSR
While search engines have got better in recent years at indexing content that was rendered with client-side JavaScript, server-side rendered content is indexed more frequently and reliably. SvelteKit employs SSR by default, and while you can disable it in handle, you should leave it on unless you have a good reason not to.

SvelteKit’s rendering is highly configurable and you can implement dynamic rendering if necessary. It’s not generally recommended, since SSR has other benefits beyond SEO.

Performance
Signals such as Core Web Vitals impact search engine ranking. Because Svelte and SvelteKit introduce minimal overhead, they make it easier to build high performance sites. You can test your site’s performance using Google’s PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse. With just a few key actions like using SvelteKit’s default hybrid rendering mode and optimizing your images, you can greatly improve your site’s speed. Read the performance page for more details.

Normalized URLs
SvelteKit redirects pathnames with trailing slashes to ones without (or vice versa depending on your configuration), as duplicate URLs are bad for SEO.

Manual setup
<title> and <meta>
Every page should have well-written and unique <title> and <meta name="description"> elements inside a <svelte:head>. Guidance on how to write descriptive titles and descriptions, along with other suggestions on making content understandable by search engines, can be found on Google’s Lighthouse SEO audits documentation.

A common pattern is to return SEO-related data from page load functions, then use it (as page.data) in a <svelte:head> in your root layout.

Sitemaps
Sitemaps help search engines prioritize pages within your site, particularly when you have a large amount of content. You can create a sitemap dynamically using an endpoint:

src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server

export async function GET() {
	return new Response(
		`
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
		<urlset
			xmlns="https://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
			xmlns:xhtml="https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
			xmlns:mobile="https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-mobile/1.0"
			xmlns:news="https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-news/0.9"
			xmlns:image="https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1"
			xmlns:video="https://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-video/1.1"
		>
			<!-- <url> elements go here -->
		</urlset>`.trim(),
		{
			headers: {
				'Content-Type': 'application/xml'
			}
		}
	);
}
AMP
An unfortunate reality of modern web development is that it is sometimes necessary to create an Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) version of your site. In SvelteKit this can be done by setting the inlineStyleThreshold option...

svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		// since <link rel="stylesheet"> isn't
		// allowed, inline all styles
		inlineStyleThreshold: Infinity
	}
};

export default config;
...disabling csr in your root +layout.js / +layout.server.js...

src/routes/+layout.server

export const csr = false;
...adding amp to your app.html


<html amp>
...
...and transforming the HTML using transformPageChunk along with transform imported from @sveltejs/amp:

src/hooks.server

import * as amp from '@sveltejs/amp';
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	let buffer = '';
	return await resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {
			buffer += html;
			if (done) return amp.transform(buffer);
		}
	});
};
To prevent shipping any unused CSS as a result of transforming the page to amp, we can use dropcss:

src/hooks.server

import * as amp from '@sveltejs/amp';
import dropcss from 'dropcss';
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	let buffer = '';

	return await resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {
			buffer += html;

			if (done) {
				let css = '';
				const markup = amp
					.transform(buffer)
					.replace('⚡', 'amp') // dropcss can't handle this character
					.replace(/<style amp-custom([^>]*?)>([^]+?)<\/style>/, (match, attributes, contents) => {
						css = contents;
						return `<style amp-custom${attributes}></style>`;
					});

				css = dropcss({ css, html: markup }).css;
				return markup.replace('</style>', `${css}</style>`);
			}
		}
	});
};
It’s a good idea to use the handle hook to validate the transformed HTML using amphtml-validator, but only if you’re prerendering pages since it’s very slow.

What can I make with SvelteKit?
See the documentation regarding project types for more details.

How do I include details from package.json in my application?
If you’d like to include your application’s version number or other information from package.json in your application, you can load JSON like so:

svelte.config

import pkg from './package.json' with { type: 'json' };
How do I fix the error I’m getting trying to include a package?
Most issues related to including a library are due to incorrect packaging. You can check if a library’s packaging is compatible with Node.js by entering it into the publint website.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when checking if a library is packaged correctly:

exports takes precedence over the other entry point fields such as main and module. Adding an exports field may not be backwards-compatible as it prevents deep imports.
ESM files should end with .mjs unless "type": "module" is set in which any case CommonJS files should end with .cjs.
main should be defined if exports is not. It should be either a CommonJS or ESM file and adhere to the previous bullet. If a module field is defined, it should refer to an ESM file.
Svelte components should be distributed as uncompiled .svelte files with any JS in the package written as ESM only. Custom script and style languages, like TypeScript and SCSS, should be preprocessed as vanilla JS and CSS respectively. We recommend using svelte-package for packaging Svelte libraries, which will do this for you.
Libraries work best in the browser with Vite when they distribute an ESM version, especially if they are dependencies of a Svelte component library. You may wish to suggest to library authors that they provide an ESM version. However, CommonJS (CJS) dependencies should work as well since, by default, vite-plugin-svelte will ask Vite to pre-bundle them using esbuild to convert them to ESM.

If you are still encountering issues we recommend searching both the Vite issue tracker and the issue tracker of the library in question. Sometimes issues can be worked around by fiddling with the optimizeDeps or ssr config values though we recommend this as only a short-term workaround in favor of fixing the library in question.

How do I use the view transitions API?
While SvelteKit does not have any specific integration with view transitions, you can call document.startViewTransition in onNavigate to trigger a view transition on every client-side navigation.


import { onNavigate } from '$app/navigation';

onNavigate((navigation) => {
	if (!document.startViewTransition) return;

	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		document.startViewTransition(async () => {
			resolve();
			await navigation.complete;
		});
	});
});
For more, see “Unlocking view transitions” on the Svelte blog.

How do I set up a database?
Put the code to query your database in a server route - don’t query the database in .svelte files. You can create a db.js or similar that sets up a connection immediately and makes the client accessible throughout the app as a singleton. You can execute any one-time setup code in hooks.server.js and import your database helpers into any endpoint that needs them.

You can use the Svelte CLI to automatically set up database integrations.

How do I use a client-side library accessing document or window?
If you need access to the document or window variables or otherwise need code to run only on the client-side you can wrap it in a browser check:


import { browser } from '$app/environment';

if (browser) {
	// client-only code here
}
You can also run code in onMount if you’d like to run it after the component has been first rendered to the DOM:


import { onMount } from 'svelte';

onMount(async () => {
	const { method } = await import('some-browser-only-library');
	method('hello world');
});
If the library you’d like to use is side-effect free you can also statically import it and it will be tree-shaken out in the server-side build where onMount will be automatically replaced with a no-op:


import { onMount } from 'svelte';
import { method } from 'some-browser-only-library';

onMount(() => {
	method('hello world');
});
Finally, you may also consider using an {#await} block:

index

<script lang="ts">
	import { browser } from '$app/environment';

	const ComponentConstructor = browser ?
		import('some-browser-only-library').then((module) => module.Component) :
		new Promise(() => {});
</script>

{#await ComponentConstructor}
	<p>Loading...</p>
{:then component}
	<svelte:component this={component} />
{:catch error}
	<p>Something went wrong: {error.message}</p>
{/await}
How do I use a different backend API server?
You can use event.fetch to request data from an external API server, but be aware that you would need to deal with CORS, which will result in complications such as generally requiring requests to be preflighted resulting in higher latency. Requests to a separate subdomain may also increase latency due to an additional DNS lookup, TLS setup, etc. If you wish to use this method, you may find handleFetch helpful.

Another approach is to set up a proxy to bypass CORS headaches. In production, you would rewrite a path like /api to the API server; for local development, use Vite’s server.proxy option.

How to setup rewrites in production will depend on your deployment platform. If rewrites aren’t an option, you could alternatively add an API route:

src/routes/api/[...path]/+server

import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const GET: RequestHandler = ({ params, url }) => {
	return fetch(`https://example.com/${params.path + url.search}`);
};
(Note that you may also need to proxy POST / PATCH etc requests, and forward request.headers, depending on your needs.)

How do I use middleware?
adapter-node builds a middleware that you can use with your own server for production mode. In dev, you can add middleware to Vite by using a Vite plugin. For example:


import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';

/** @type {import('vite').Plugin} */
const myPlugin = {
	name: 'log-request-middleware',
	configureServer(server) {
		server.middlewares.use((req, res, next) => {
			console.log(`Got request ${req.url}`);
			next();
		});
	}
};

/** @type {import('vite').UserConfig} */
const config = {
	plugins: [myPlugin, sveltekit()]
};

export default config;
See Vite’s configureServer docs for more details including how to control ordering.

How do I use Yarn?
Does it work with Yarn 2?
Sort of. The Plug’n'Play feature, aka ‘pnp’, is broken (it deviates from the Node module resolution algorithm, and doesn’t yet work with native JavaScript modules which SvelteKit — along with an increasing number of packages — uses). You can use nodeLinker: 'node-modules' in your .yarnrc.yml file to disable pnp, but it’s probably easier to just use npm or pnpm, which is similarly fast and efficient but without the compatibility headaches.

How do I use with Yarn 3?
Currently ESM Support within the latest Yarn (version 3) is considered experimental.

The below seems to work although your results may vary. First create a new application:


yarn create svelte myapp
cd myapp
And enable Yarn Berry:


yarn set version berry
yarn install
One of the more interesting features of Yarn Berry is the ability to have a single global cache for packages, instead of having multiple copies for each project on the disk. However, setting enableGlobalCache to true causes building to fail, so it is recommended to add the following to the .yarnrc.yml file:


nodeLinker: node-modules
This will cause packages to be downloaded into a local node_modules directory but avoids the above problem and is your best bet for using version 3 of Yarn at this point in time.

Integration FAQs
vitePreprocess
Including vitePreprocess in your project will allow you to use the various flavors of CSS that Vite supports: PostCSS, SCSS, Less, Stylus, and SugarSS. If you set your project up with TypeScript it will be included by default:


// svelte.config.js
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  preprocess: [vitePreprocess()]
};

export default config;
You will also need to use a preprocessor if you’re using TypeScript with Svelte 4. TypeScript is supported natively in Svelte 5 if you’re using only the type syntax. To use more complex TypeScript syntax in Svelte 5, you will need still need a preprocessor and can use vitePreprocess({ script: true }).

Add-ons
Run npx sv add to setup many different complex integrations with a single command including:

Additional integrations
svelte-preprocess
svelte-preprocess has some additional functionality not found in vitePreprocess such as support for Pug, Babel, and global styles. However, vitePreprocess may be faster and require less configuration, so it is used by default. Note that CoffeeScript is not supported by SvelteKit.

You will need to install svelte-preprocess with npm i -D svelte-preprocess and add it to your svelte.config.js. After that, you will often need to install the corresponding library such as npm i -D sass or npm i -D less.

Vite plugins
Since SvelteKit projects are built with Vite, you can use Vite plugins to enhance your project. See a list of available plugins at vitejs/awesome-vite.

References
In addition to the @debug tag, you can also debug Svelte and SvelteKit projects using breakpoints within various tools and development environments. This includes both frontend and backend code.

The following guides assume your JavaScript runtime environment is Node.js.

Visual Studio Code
With the built-in debug terminal, you can set up breakpoints in source files within VSCode.

Open the command palette: CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P.
Find and launch “Debug: JavaScript Debug Terminal”.
Start your project using the debug terminal. For example: npm run dev.
Set some breakpoints in your client or server-side source code.
Trigger the breakpoint.
Launch via debug pane
You may alternatively set up a .vscode/launch.json in your project. To set one up automatically:

Go to the “Run and Debug” pane.
In the “Run” select menu, choose “Node.js...”.
Select the “run script” that corresponds to your project, such as “Run script: dev”.
Press the “Start debugging” play button, or hit F5 to begin breakpoint debugging.
Here’s an example launch.json:


{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"command": "npm run dev",
			"name": "Run development server",
			"request": "launch",
			"type": "node-terminal"
		}
	]
}

It’s possible to debug Node.js applications using a browser-based debugger.

Note this only works with debugging client-side SvelteKit source maps.

Run the --inspect flag when starting the Vite server with Node.js. For instance: NODE_OPTIONS="--inspect" npm run dev
Open your site in a new tab. Typically at localhost:5173.
Open your browser’s dev tools, and click on the “Open dedicated DevTools for Node.js” icon near the top-left. It should display the Node.js logo.
Set up breakpoints and debug your application.
You may alternatively open the debugger devtools by navigating to chrome://inspect in Google Chrome, or edge://inspect in Microsoft Edge.

Updated dependency requirements
SvelteKit 2.12: $app/stores deprecated
Upgrading from SvelteKit version 1 to version 2 should be mostly seamless. There are a few breaking changes to note, which are listed here. You can use npx sv migrate sveltekit-2 to migrate some of these changes automatically.

We highly recommend upgrading to the most recent 1.x version before upgrading to 2.0, so that you can take advantage of targeted deprecation warnings. We also recommend updating to Svelte 4 first: Later versions of SvelteKit 1.x support it, and SvelteKit 2.0 requires it.

redirect and error are no longer thrown by you
Previously, you had to throw the values returned from error(...) and redirect(...) yourself. In SvelteKit 2 this is no longer the case — calling the functions is sufficient.


import { error } from '@sveltejs/kit'

// ...
throw error(500, 'something went wrong');
error(500, 'something went wrong');
svelte-migrate will do these changes automatically for you.

If the error or redirect is thrown inside a try {...} block (hint: don’t do this!), you can distinguish them from unexpected errors using isHttpError and isRedirect imported from @sveltejs/kit.

path is required when setting cookies
When receiving a Set-Cookie header that doesn’t specify a path, browsers will set the cookie path to the parent of the resource in question. This behaviour isn’t particularly helpful or intuitive, and frequently results in bugs because the developer expected the cookie to apply to the domain as a whole.

As of SvelteKit 2.0, you need to set a path when calling cookies.set(...), cookies.delete(...) or cookies.serialize(...) so that there’s no ambiguity. Most of the time, you probably want to use path: '/', but you can set it to whatever you like, including relative paths — '' means ‘the current path’, '.' means ‘the current directory’.


/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */
export function load({ cookies }) {
	cookies.set(name, value, { path: '/' });
	return { response }
}
svelte-migrate will add comments highlighting the locations that need to be adjusted.

Top-level promises are no longer awaited
In SvelteKit version 1, if the top-level properties of the object returned from a load function were promises, they were automatically awaited. With the introduction of streaming this behavior became a bit awkward as it forces you to nest your streamed data one level deep.

As of version 2, SvelteKit no longer differentiates between top-level and non-top-level promises. To get back the blocking behavior, use await (with Promise.all to prevent waterfalls, where appropriate):


// If you have a single promise
/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */
export async function load({ fetch }) {
	const response = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());
	return { response }
}

// If you have multiple promises
/** @type {import('./$types').PageServerLoad} */
export async function load({ fetch }) {
	const a = fetch(url1).then(r => r.json());
	const b = fetch(url2).then(r => r.json());
	const [a, b] = await Promise.all([
	  fetch(url1).then(r => r.json()),
	  fetch(url2).then(r => r.json()),
	]);
	return { a, b };
}
goto(...) changes
goto(...) no longer accepts external URLs. To navigate to an external URL, use window.location.href = url. The state object now determines $page.state and must adhere to the App.PageState interface, if declared. See shallow routing for more details.

paths are now relative by default
In SvelteKit 1, %sveltekit.assets% in your app.html was replaced with a relative path by default (i.e. . or .. or ../.. etc, depending on the path being rendered) during server-side rendering unless the paths.relative config option was explicitly set to false. The same was true for base and assets imported from $app/paths, but only if the paths.relative option was explicitly set to true.

This inconsistency is fixed in version 2. Paths are either always relative or always absolute, depending on the value of paths.relative. It defaults to true as this results in more portable apps: if the base is something other than the app expected (as is the case when viewed on the Internet Archive, for example) or unknown at build time (as is the case when deploying to IPFS and so on), fewer things are likely to break.

Server fetches are not trackable anymore
Previously it was possible to track URLs from fetches on the server in order to rerun load functions. This poses a possible security risk (private URLs leaking), and for this reason it was behind the dangerZone.trackServerFetches setting, which is now removed.

preloadCode arguments must be prefixed with base
SvelteKit exposes two functions, preloadCode and preloadData, for programmatically loading the code and data associated with a particular path. In version 1, there was a subtle inconsistency — the path passed to preloadCode did not need to be prefixed with the base path (if set), while the path passed to preloadData did.

This is fixed in SvelteKit 2 — in both cases, the path should be prefixed with base if it is set.

Additionally, preloadCode now takes a single argument rather than n arguments.

resolvePath has been removed
SvelteKit 1 included a function called resolvePath which allows you to resolve a route ID (like /blog/[slug]) and a set of parameters (like { slug: 'hello' }) to a pathname. Unfortunately the return value didn’t include the base path, limiting its usefulness in cases where base was set.

For this reason, SvelteKit 2 replaces resolvePath with a (slightly better named) function called resolveRoute, which is imported from $app/paths and which takes base into account.


import { resolvePath } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import { base } from '$app/paths';
import { resolveRoute } from '$app/paths';

const path = base + resolvePath('/blog/[slug]', { slug });
const path = resolveRoute('/blog/[slug]', { slug });
svelte-migrate will do the method replacement for you, though if you later prepend the result with base, you need to remove that yourself.

Improved error handling
Errors are handled inconsistently in SvelteKit 1. Some errors trigger the handleError hook but there is no good way to discern their status (for example, the only way to tell a 404 from a 500 is by seeing if event.route.id is null), while others (such as 405 errors for POST requests to pages without actions) don’t trigger handleError at all, but should. In the latter case, the resulting $page.error will deviate from the App.Error type, if it is specified.

SvelteKit 2 cleans this up by calling handleError hooks with two new properties: status and message. For errors thrown from your code (or library code called by your code) the status will be 500 and the message will be Internal Error. While error.message may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed to users, message is safe.

Dynamic environment variables cannot be used during prerendering
The $env/dynamic/public and $env/dynamic/private modules provide access to run time environment variables, as opposed to the build time environment variables exposed by $env/static/public and $env/static/private.

During prerendering in SvelteKit 1, they are one and the same. This means that prerendered pages that make use of ‘dynamic’ environment variables are really ‘baking in’ build time values, which is incorrect. Worse, $env/dynamic/public is populated in the browser with these stale values if the user happens to land on a prerendered page before navigating to dynamically-rendered pages.

Because of this, dynamic environment variables can no longer be read during prerendering in SvelteKit 2 — you should use the static modules instead. If the user lands on a prerendered page, SvelteKit will request up-to-date values for $env/dynamic/public from the server (by default from a module called /_app/env.js) instead of reading them from the server-rendered HTML.

form and data have been removed from use:enhance callbacks
If you provide a callback to use:enhance, it will be called with an object containing various useful properties.

In SvelteKit 1, those properties included form and data. These were deprecated some time ago in favour of formElement and formData, and have been removed altogether in SvelteKit 2.

Forms containing file inputs must use multipart/form-data
If a form contains an <input type="file"> but does not have an enctype="multipart/form-data" attribute, non-JS submissions will omit the file. SvelteKit 2 will throw an error if it encounters a form like this during a use:enhance submission to ensure that your forms work correctly when JavaScript is not present.

Generated tsconfig.json is more strict
Previously, the generated tsconfig.json was trying its best to still produce a somewhat valid config when your tsconfig.json included paths or baseUrl. In SvelteKit 2, the validation is more strict and will warn when you use either paths or baseUrl in your tsconfig.json. These settings are used to generate path aliases and you should use the alias config option in your svelte.config.js instead, to also create a corresponding alias for the bundler.

getRequest no longer throws errors
The @sveltejs/kit/node module exports helper functions for use in Node environments, including getRequest which turns a Node ClientRequest into a standard Request object.

In SvelteKit 1, getRequest could throw if the Content-Length header exceeded the specified size limit. In SvelteKit 2, the error will not be thrown until later, when the request body (if any) is being read. This enables better diagnostics and simpler code.

vitePreprocess is no longer exported from @sveltejs/kit/vite
Since @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte is now a peer dependency, SvelteKit 2 no longer re-exports vitePreprocess. You should import it directly from @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte.

Updated dependency requirements
SvelteKit 2 requires Node 18.13 or higher, and the following minimum dependency versions:

svelte@4
vite@5
typescript@5
@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@3 (this is now required as a peerDependency of SvelteKit — previously it was directly depended upon)
@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare@3 (if you’re using these adapters)
@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers@2
@sveltejs/adapter-netlify@3
@sveltejs/adapter-node@2
@sveltejs/adapter-static@3
@sveltejs/adapter-vercel@4
svelte-migrate will update your package.json for you.

As part of the TypeScript upgrade, the generated tsconfig.json (the one your tsconfig.json extends from) now uses "moduleResolution": "bundler" (which is recommended by the TypeScript team, as it properly resolves types from packages with an exports map in package.json) and verbatimModuleSyntax (which replaces the existing importsNotUsedAsValues  and preserveValueImports flags — if you have those in your tsconfig.json, remove them. svelte-migrate will do this for you).

SvelteKit 2.12: $app/stores deprecated
SvelteKit 2.12 introduced $app/state based on the Svelte 5 runes API. $app/state provides everything that $app/stores provides but with more flexibility as to where and how you use it. Most importantly, the page object is now fine-grained, e.g. updates to page.state will not invalidate page.data and vice-versa.

As a consequence, $app/stores is deprecated and subject to be removed in SvelteKit 3. We recommend upgrading to Svelte 5, if you haven’t already, and then migrate away from $app/stores. Most of the replacements should be pretty simple: Replace the $app/stores import with $app/state and remove the $ prefixes from the usage sites.


<script>
	import { page } from '$app/stores';
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

{$page.data}
{page.data}
Use npx sv migrate app-state to auto-migrate most of your $app/stores usages inside .svelte components.

Pages and layouts

Integrations
SvelteKit is the successor to Sapper and shares many elements of its design.

If you have an existing Sapper app that you plan to migrate to SvelteKit, there are a number of changes you will need to make. You may find it helpful to view some examples while migrating.

package.json
type: “module”
Add "type": "module" to your package.json. You can do this step separately from the rest as part of an incremental migration if you are using Sapper 0.29.3 or newer.

dependencies
Remove polka or express, if you’re using one of those, and any middleware such as sirv or compression.

devDependencies
Remove sapper from your devDependencies and replace it with @sveltejs/kit and whichever adapter you plan to use (see next section).

scripts
Any scripts that reference sapper should be updated:

sapper build should become vite build using the Node adapter
sapper export should become vite build using the static adapter
sapper dev should become vite dev
node __sapper__/build should become node build
Project files
The bulk of your app, in src/routes, can be left where it is, but several project files will need to be moved or updated.

Configuration
Your webpack.config.js or rollup.config.js should be replaced with a svelte.config.js, as documented here. Svelte preprocessor options should be moved to config.preprocess.

You will need to add an adapter. sapper build is roughly equivalent to adapter-node while sapper export is roughly equivalent to adapter-static, though you might prefer to use an adapter designed for the platform you’re deploying to.

If you were using plugins for filetypes that are not automatically handled by Vite, you will need to find Vite equivalents and add them to the Vite config.

src/client.js
This file has no equivalent in SvelteKit. Any custom logic (beyond sapper.start(...)) should be expressed in your +layout.svelte file, inside an onMount callback.

src/server.js
When using adapter-node the equivalent is a custom server. Otherwise, this file has no direct equivalent, since SvelteKit apps can run in serverless environments.

src/service-worker.js
Most imports from @sapper/service-worker have equivalents in $service-worker:

files is unchanged
routes has been removed
shell is now build
timestamp is now version
src/template.html
The src/template.html file should be renamed src/app.html.

Remove %sapper.base%, %sapper.scripts% and %sapper.styles%. Replace %sapper.head% with %sveltekit.head% and %sapper.html% with %sveltekit.body%. The <div id="sapper"> is no longer necessary.

src/node_modules
A common pattern in Sapper apps is to put your internal library in a directory inside src/node_modules. This doesn’t work with Vite, so we use src/lib instead.

Pages and layouts
Renamed files
Routes now are made up of the folder name exclusively to remove ambiguity, the folder names leading up to a +page.svelte correspond to the route. See the routing docs for an overview. The following shows a old/new comparison:

Old	New
routes/about/index.svelte	routes/about/+page.svelte
routes/about.svelte	routes/about/+page.svelte
Your custom error page component should be renamed from _error.svelte to +error.svelte. Any _layout.svelte files should likewise be renamed +layout.svelte. Any other files are ignored.

Imports
The goto, prefetch and prefetchRoutes imports from @sapper/app should be replaced with goto, preloadData and preloadCode imports respectively from $app/navigation.

The stores import from @sapper/app should be replaced — see the Stores section below.

Any files you previously imported from directories in src/node_modules will need to be replaced with $lib imports.

Preload
As before, pages and layouts can export a function that allows data to be loaded before rendering takes place.

This function has been renamed from preload to load, it now lives in a +page.js (or +layout.js) next to its +page.svelte (or +layout.svelte), and its API has changed. Instead of two arguments — page and session — there is a single event argument.

There is no more this object, and consequently no this.fetch, this.error or this.redirect. Instead, you can get fetch from the input methods, and both error and redirect are now thrown.

Stores
In Sapper, you would get references to provided stores like so:


import { stores } from '@sapper/app';
const { preloading, page, session } = stores();
The page store still exists; preloading has been replaced with a navigating store that contains from and to properties. page now has url and params properties, but no path or query.

You access them differently in SvelteKit. stores is now getStores, but in most cases it is unnecessary since you can import navigating, and page directly from $app/stores. If you’re on Svelte 5 and SvelteKit 2.12 or higher, consider using $app/state instead.

Routing
Regex routes are no longer supported. Instead, use advanced route matching.

Segments
Previously, layout components received a segment prop indicating the child segment. This has been removed; you should use the more flexible $page.url.pathname (or page.url.pathname) value to derive the segment you’re interested in.

URLs
In Sapper, all relative URLs were resolved against the base URL — usually /, unless the basepath option was used — rather than against the current page.

This caused problems and is no longer the case in SvelteKit. Instead, relative URLs are resolved against the current page (or the destination page, for fetch URLs in load functions) instead. In most cases, it’s easier to use root-relative (i.e. starts with /) URLs, since their meaning is not context-dependent.

<a> attributes
sapper:prefetch is now data-sveltekit-preload-data
sapper:noscroll is now data-sveltekit-noscroll
Endpoints
In Sapper, server routes received the req and res objects exposed by Node’s http module (or the augmented versions provided by frameworks like Polka and Express).

SvelteKit is designed to be agnostic as to where the app is running — it could be running on a Node server, but could equally be running on a serverless platform or in a Cloudflare Worker. For that reason, you no longer interact directly with req and res. Your endpoints will need to be updated to match the new signature.

To support this environment-agnostic behavior, fetch is now available in the global context, so you don’t need to import node-fetch, cross-fetch, or similar server-side fetch implementations in order to use it.

Integrations
See integrations for detailed information about integrations.

HTML minifier
Sapper includes html-minifier by default. SvelteKit does not include this, but you can add it as a prod dependency and then use it through a hook:


import { minify } from 'html-minifier';
import { building } from '$app/environment';

const minification_options = {
	collapseBooleanAttributes: true,
	collapseWhitespace: true,
	conservativeCollapse: true,
	decodeEntities: true,
	html5: true,
	ignoreCustomComments: [/^#/],
	minifyCSS: true,
	minifyJS: false,
	removeAttributeQuotes: true,
	removeComments: false, // some hydration code needs comments, so leave them in
	removeOptionalTags: true,
	removeRedundantAttributes: true,
	removeScriptTypeAttributes: true,
	removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,
	sortAttributes: true,
	sortClassName: true
};

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */
export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
	let page = '';

	return resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {
			page += html;
			if (done) {
				return building ? minify(page, minification_options) : page;
			}
		}
	});
}
Note that prerendering is false when using vite preview to test the production build of the site, so to verify the results of minifying, you’ll need to inspect the built HTML files directly.

Routing
SPA
SSG
SSR
The core of SvelteKit provides a highly configurable rendering engine. This section describes some of the terms used when discussing rendering. A reference for setting these options is provided in the documentation above.

CSR
Client-side rendering (CSR) is the generation of the page contents in the web browser using JavaScript.

In SvelteKit, client-side rendering will be used by default, but you can turn off JavaScript with the csr = false page option.

Edge
Rendering on the edge refers to rendering an application in a content delivery network (CDN) near the user. Edge rendering allows the request and response for a page to travel a shorter distance thus improving latency.

Hybrid app
SvelteKit uses a hybrid rendering mode by default where it loads the initial HTML from the server (SSR), and then updates the page contents on subsequent navigations via client-side rendering (CSR).

Hydration
Svelte components store some state and update the DOM when the state is updated. When fetching data during SSR, by default SvelteKit will store this data and transmit it to the client along with the server-rendered HTML. The components can then be initialized on the client with that data without having to call the same API endpoints again. Svelte will then check that the DOM is in the expected state and attach event listeners in a process called hydration. Once the components are fully hydrated, they can react to changes to their properties just like any newly created Svelte component.

In SvelteKit, pages will be hydrated by default, but you can turn off JavaScript with the csr = false page option.

ISR
Incremental static regeneration (ISR) allows you to generate static pages on your site as visitors request those pages without redeploying. This may reduces build times compared to SSG sites with a large number of pages. You can do ISR with adapter-vercel.

MPA
Traditional applications that render each page view on the server — such as those written in languages other than JavaScript — are often referred to as multi-page apps (MPA).

Prerendering
Prerendering means computing the contents of a page at build time and saving the HTML for display. This approach has the same benefits as traditional server-rendered pages, but avoids recomputing the page for each visitor and so scales nearly for free as the number of visitors increases. The tradeoff is that the build process is more expensive and prerendered content can only be updated by building and deploying a new version of the application.

Not all pages can be prerendered. The basic rule is this: for content to be prerenderable, any two users hitting it directly must get the same content from the server, and the page must not contain actions. Note that you can still prerender content that is loaded based on the page’s parameters as long as all users will be seeing the same prerendered content.

Pre-rendered pages are not limited to static content. You can build personalized pages if user-specific data is fetched and rendered client-side. This is subject to the caveat that you will experience the downsides of not doing SSR for that content as discussed above.

In SvelteKit, you can control prerendering with the prerender page option and prerender config in svelte.config.js.

PWA
A progressive web app (PWA) is an app that’s built using web APIs and technologies, but functions like a mobile or desktop app. Sites served as PWAs can be installed, allowing you to add a shortcut to the application on your launcher, home screen, or start menu. Many PWAs will utilize service workers to build offline capabilities.

Routing
By default, when you navigate to a new page (by clicking on a link or using the browser’s forward or back buttons), SvelteKit will intercept the attempted navigation and handle it instead of allowing the browser to send a request to the server for the destination page. SvelteKit will then update the displayed contents on the client by rendering the component for the new page, which in turn can make calls to the necessary API endpoints. This process of updating the page on the client in response to attempted navigation is called client-side routing.

In SvelteKit, client-side routing will be used by default, but you can skip it with data-sveltekit-reload.

SPA
A single-page app (SPA) is an application in which all requests to the server load a single HTML file which then does client-side rendering based on the requested URL. All navigation is handled on the client-side in a process called client-side routing with per-page contents being updated and common layout elements remaining largely unchanged. Throughout this site, when we refer to a SPA, we use this definition where a SPA simply serves an empty shell on the initial request. It should not be confused with a hybrid app, which serves HTML on the initial request. It has a large performance impact by forcing two network round trips before rendering can begin. Because SPA mode has large negative performance and SEO impacts, it is recommended only in very limited circumstances such as when being wrapped in a mobile app.

In SvelteKit, you can build SPAs with adapter-static.

SSG
Static Site Generation (SSG) is a term that refers to a site where every page is prerendered. One benefit of fully prerendering a site is that you do not need to maintain or pay for servers to perform SSR. Once generated, the site can be served from CDNs, leading to great “time to first byte” performance. This delivery model is often referred to as JAMstack.

In SvelteKit, you can do static site generation by using adapter-static or by configuring every page to be prerendered using the prerender page option or prerender config in svelte.config.js.

SSR
Server-side rendering (SSR) is the generation of the page contents on the server. Returning the page contents from the server via SSR or prerendering is highly preferred for performance and SEO. It significantly improves performance by avoiding the introduction of extra round trips necessary in a SPA, and makes your app accessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens more often than you probably think). While some search engines can index content that is dynamically generated on the client-side, it is likely to take longer even in these cases.

In SvelteKit, pages are server-side rendered by default. You can disable SSR with the ssr page option.

VERSION
const VERSION: string;
error
Throws an error with a HTTP status code and an optional message. When called during request handling, this will cause SvelteKit to return an error response without invoking handleError. Make sure you’re not catching the thrown error, which would prevent SvelteKit from handling it.

function error(status: number, body: App.Error): never;
function error(
	status: number,
	body?: {
		message: string;
	} extends App.Error
		? App.Error | string | undefined
		: never
): never;
fail
Create an ActionFailure object. Call when form submission fails.

function fail(status: number): ActionFailure<undefined>;
function fail<T = undefined>(
	status: number,
	data: T
): ActionFailure<T>;
isActionFailure
Checks whether this is an action failure thrown by fail.

function isActionFailure(e: unknown): e is ActionFailure;
isHttpError
Checks whether this is an error thrown by error.

function isHttpError<T extends number>(
	e: unknown,
	status?: T
): e is HttpError_1 & {
	status: T extends undefined ? never : T;
};
isRedirect
Checks whether this is a redirect thrown by redirect.

function isRedirect(e: unknown): e is Redirect_1;
json
Create a JSON Response object from the supplied data.

function json(data: any, init?: ResponseInit): Response;
normalizeUrl
Available since 2.18.0

Strips possible SvelteKit-internal suffixes and trailing slashes from the URL pathname. Returns the normalized URL as well as a method for adding the potential suffix back based on a new pathname (possibly including search) or URL.


import { normalizeUrl } from '@sveltejs/kit';

const { url, denormalize } = normalizeUrl('/blog/post/__data.json');
console.log(url.pathname); // /blog/post
console.log(denormalize('/blog/post/a')); // /blog/post/a/__data.json
function normalizeUrl(url: URL | string): {
	url: URL;
	wasNormalized: boolean;
	denormalize: (url?: string | URL) => URL;
};
redirect
Redirect a request. When called during request handling, SvelteKit will return a redirect response. Make sure you’re not catching the thrown redirect, which would prevent SvelteKit from handling it.

Most common status codes:

303 See Other: redirect as a GET request (often used after a form POST request)
307 Temporary Redirect: redirect will keep the request method
308 Permanent Redirect: redirect will keep the request method, SEO will be transferred to the new page
See all redirect status codes

function redirect(
	status:
		| 300
		| 301
		| 302
		| 303
		| 304
		| 305
		| 306
		| 307
		| 308
		| ({} & number),
	location: string | URL
): never;
text
Create a Response object from the supplied body.

function text(body: string, init?: ResponseInit): Response;
Action
Shape of a form action method that is part of export const actions = {...} in +page.server.js. See form actions for more information.

type Action<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	OutputData extends Record<string, any> | void = Record<
		string,
		any
	> | void,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> = (
	event: RequestEvent<Params, RouteId>
) => MaybePromise<OutputData>;
ActionFailure
interface ActionFailure<T = undefined> {…}
status: number;
data: T;
[uniqueSymbol]: true;
ActionResult
When calling a form action via fetch, the response will be one of these shapes.


<form method="post" use:enhance={() => {
	return ({ result }) => {
		// result is of type ActionResult
	};
}}
type ActionResult<
	Success extends
		| Record<string, unknown>

Adapter
Adapters are responsible for taking the production build and turning it into something that can be deployed to a platform of your choosing.

interface Adapter {…}
name: string;
The name of the adapter, using for logging. Will typically correspond to the package name.

	opts?: {
		filter?(basename: string): boolean;
		replace?: Record<string, string>;
	}
) => string[];
from the source file or directory
to the destination file or directory
opts.filter a function to determine whether a file or directory should be copied
opts.replace a map of strings to replace
returns an array of files that were copied
Copy a file or directory.

hasServerInstrumentationFile: () => boolean;
returns true if the server instrumentation file exists, false otherwise
available since v2.31.0
Check if the server instrumentation file exists.

instrument: (args: {
	entrypoint: string;
	instrumentation: string;
	start?: string;
	module?:
		| {
				exports: string[];
		  }
		| {
				generateText: (args: { instrumentation: string; start: string }) => string;
		  };
}) => void;
options an object containing the following properties:
options.entrypoint the path to the entrypoint to trace.
options.instrumentation the path to the instrumentation file.
options.start the name of the start file. This is what entrypoint will be renamed to.
options.module configuration for the resulting entrypoint module.
options.module.generateText a function that receives the relative paths to the instrumentation and start files, and generates the text of the module to be traced. If not provided, the default implementation will be used, which uses top-level await.
available since v2.31.0
Instrument entrypoint with instrumentation.

Renames entrypoint to start and creates a new module at entrypoint which imports instrumentation and then dynamically imports start. This allows the module hooks necessary for instrumentation libraries to be loaded prior to any application code.

Caveats:

“Live exports” will not work. If your adapter uses live exports, your users will need to manually import the server instrumentation on startup.
If tla is false, OTEL auto-instrumentation may not work properly. Use it if your environment supports it.
Use hasServerInstrumentationFile to check if the user has a server instrumentation file; if they don’t, you shouldn’t do this.
compress: (directory: string) => Promise<void>;
directory The directory containing the files to be compressed
Compress files in directory with gzip and brotli, where appropriate. Generates .gz and .br files alongside the originals.

ClientInit

The init will be invoked once the app starts in the browser

type ClientInit = () => MaybePromise<void>;
Config
See the configuration reference for details.

Cookies
interface Cookies {…}
get: (name: string, opts?: import('cookie').CookieParseOptions) => string | undefined;
name the name of the cookie

Gets a cookie that was previously set with cookies.set, or from the request headers.

getAll: (opts?: import('cookie').CookieParseOptions) => Array<{ name: string; value: string }>;
opts the options, passed directly to cookie.parse. See documentation here
Gets all cookies that were previously set with cookies.set, or from the request headers.

set: (
	name: string,
	value: string,
	opts: import('cookie').CookieSerializeOptions & { path: string }
) => void;
name the name of the cookie
value the cookie value
opts the options, passed directly to cookie.serialize. See documentation here
Sets a cookie. This will add a set-cookie header to the response, but also make the cookie available via cookies.get or cookies.getAll during the current request.

The httpOnly and secure options are true by default (except on http://localhost, where secure is false), and must be explicitly disabled if you want cookies to be readable by client-side JavaScript and/or transmitted over HTTP. The sameSite option defaults to lax.

You must specify a path for the cookie. In most cases you should explicitly set path: '/' to make the cookie available throughout your app. You can use relative paths, or set path: '' to make the cookie only available on the current path and its children

delete: (name: string, opts: import('cookie').CookieSerializeOptions & { path: string }) => void;
name the name of the cookie
opts the options, passed directly to cookie.serialize. The path must match the path of the cookie you want to delete. See documentation here
Deletes a cookie by setting its value to an empty string and setting the expiry date in the past.

You must specify a path for the cookie. In most cases you should explicitly set path: '/' to make the cookie available throughout your app. You can use relative paths, or set path: '' to make the cookie only available on the current path and its children

serialize: (
	name: string,
	value: string,
	opts: import('cookie').CookieSerializeOptions & { path: string }
) => string;

value the cookie value
opts the options, passed directly to cookie.serialize. See documentation here
Serialize a cookie name-value pair into a Set-Cookie header string, but don’t apply it to the response.

The httpOnly and secure options are true by default (except on http://localhost, where secure is false), and must be explicitly disabled if you want cookies to be readable by client-side JavaScript and/or transmitted over HTTP. The sameSite option defaults to lax.

You must specify a path for the cookie. In most cases you should explicitly set path: '/' to make the cookie available throughout your app. You can use relative paths, or set path: '' to make the cookie only available on the current path and its children

Emulator
A collection of functions that influence the environment during dev, build and prerendering

interface Emulator {…}
platform?(details: { config: any; prerender: PrerenderOption }): MaybePromise<App.Platform>;
A function that is called with the current route config and prerender option and returns an App.Platform object

Handle
The handle hook runs every time the SvelteKit server receives a request and determines the response. It receives an event object representing the request and a function called resolve, which renders the route and generates a Response. This allows you to modify response headers or bodies, or bypass SvelteKit entirely (for implementing routes programmatically, for example).

type Handle = (input: {
	event: RequestEvent;
	resolve: (
		event: RequestEvent,
		opts?: ResolveOptions
	) => MaybePromise<Response>;
}) => MaybePromise<Response>;
HandleClientError
The client-side handleError hook runs when an unexpected error is thrown while navigating.

If an unexpected error is thrown during loading or the following render, this function will be called with the error and the event. Make sure that this function never throws an error.

type HandleClientError = (input: {
	error: unknown;
	event: NavigationEvent;
	status: number;
	message: string;
}) => MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;
HandleFetch
The handleFetch hook allows you to modify (or replace) the result of an event.fetch call that runs on the server (or during prerendering) inside an endpoint, load, action, handle, handleError or reroute.

type HandleFetch = (input: {
	event: RequestEvent;
	request: Request;
	fetch: typeof fetch;
}) => MaybePromise<Response>;
HandleServerError
The server-side handleError hook runs when an unexpected error is thrown while responding to a request.

If an unexpected error is thrown during loading or rendering, this function will be called with the error and the event. Make sure that this function never throws an error.

type HandleServerError = (input: {
	error: unknown;
	event: RequestEvent;
	status: number;
	message: string;
}) => MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;
HandleValidationError
The handleValidationError hook runs when the argument to a remote function fails validation.

It will be called with the validation issues and the event, and must return an object shape that matches App.Error.

type HandleValidationError<
	Issue extends
		StandardSchemaV1.Issue = StandardSchemaV1.Issue
> = (input: {
	issues: Issue[];
	event: RequestEvent;
}) => MaybePromise<App.Error>;
HttpError
The object returned by the error function.

interface HttpError {…}
status: number;
The HTTP status code, in the range 400-599.

body: App.Error;
The content of the error.

Invalid
A function and proxy object used to imperatively create validation errors in form handlers.

Call invalid(issue1, issue2, ...issueN) to throw a validation error. If an issue is a string, it applies to the form as a whole (and will show up in fields.allIssues()) Access properties to create field-specific issues: invalid.fieldName('message'). The type structure mirrors the input data structure for type-safe field access.

type Invalid<Input = any> = ((
	...issues: Array<string | StandardSchemaV1.Issue>
) => never) &
	InvalidField<Input>;
KitConfig
See the configuration reference for details.

LessThan
type LessThan<
	TNumber extends number,
	TArray extends any[] = []
> = TNumber extends TArray['length']
	? TArray[number]
	: LessThan<TNumber, [...TArray, TArray['length']]>;
Load
The generic form of PageLoad and LayoutLoad. You should import those from ./$types (see generated types) rather than using Load directly.

type Load<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	InputData extends Record<string, unknown> | null = Record<
		string,
		any
	> | null,
	ParentData extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<
		string,
		any
	>,
	OutputData extends Record<
		string,
		unknown
	> | void = Record<string, any> | void,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> = (
	event: LoadEvent<Params, InputData, ParentData, RouteId>
) => MaybePromise<OutputData>;
LoadEvent
The generic form of PageLoadEvent and LayoutLoadEvent. You should import those from ./$types (see generated types) rather than using LoadEvent directly.

interface LoadEvent<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	Data extends Record<string, unknown> | null = Record<
		string,
		any
	> | null,
	ParentData extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<
		string,
		any
	>,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> extends NavigationEvent<Params, RouteId> {…}
fetch: typeof fetch;
fetch is equivalent to the native fetch web API, with a few additional features:

It can be used to make credentialed requests on the server, as it inherits the cookie and authorization headers for the page request.
It can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, fetch requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).
Internal requests (e.g. for +server.js routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.
During server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the text and json methods of the Response object. Note that headers will not be serialized, unless explicitly included via filterSerializedResponseHeaders
During hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request.
You can learn more about making credentialed requests with cookies here

data: Data;
Contains the data returned by the route’s server load function (in +layout.server.js or +page.server.js), if any.

setHeaders: (headers: Record<string, string>) => void;
If you need to set headers for the response, you can do so using the this method. This is useful if you want the page to be cached, for example:

src/routes/blog/+page

export async function load({ fetch, setHeaders }) {

	const url = `https://cms.example.com/articles.json`;
	const response = await fetch(url);

	setHeaders({
		age: response.headers.get('age'),
		'cache-control': response.headers.get('cache-control')
	});

	return response.json();
}
Setting the same header multiple times (even in separate load functions) is an error — you can only set a given header once.

You cannot add a set-cookie header with setHeaders — use the cookies API in a server-only load function instead.

setHeaders has no effect when a load function runs in the browser.

parent: () => Promise<ParentData>;
await parent() returns data from parent +layout.js load functions. Implicitly, a missing +layout.js is treated as a ({ data }) => data function, meaning that it will return and forward data from parent +layout.server.js files.

Be careful not to introduce accidental waterfalls when using await parent(). If for example you only want to merge parent data into the returned output, call it after fetching your other data.

depends: (...deps: Array<`${string}:${string}`>) => void;
This function declares that the load function has a dependency on one or more URLs or custom identifiers, which can subsequently be used with invalidate() to cause load to rerun.

Most of the time you won’t need this, as fetch calls depends on your behalf — it’s only necessary if you’re using a custom API client that bypasses fetch.

URLs can be absolute or relative to the page being loaded, and must be encoded.

Custom identifiers have to be prefixed with one or more lowercase letters followed by a colon to conform to the URI specification.

The following example shows how to use depends to register a dependency on a custom identifier, which is invalidated after a button click, making the load function rerun.

src/routes/+page

let count = 0;
export async function load({ depends }) {
	depends('increase:count');

	return { count: count++ };
}
src/routes/+page

<script>
	import { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';

	let { data } = $props();

	const increase = async () => {
		await invalidate('increase:count');
	}
</script>

<p>{data.count}<p>
<button on:click={increase}>Increase Count</button>
untrack: <T>(fn: () => T) => T;
Use this function to opt out of dependency tracking for everything that is synchronously called within the callback. Example:

src/routes/+page.server

export async function load({ untrack, url }) {

	// Untrack url.pathname so that path changes don't trigger a rerun
	if (untrack(() => url.pathname === '/')) {
		return { message: 'Welcome!' };
	}
}
tracing: {…}

RequestEvent
interface RequestEvent<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> {…}
cookies: Cookies;
Get or set cookies related to the current request

fetch: typeof fetch;
fetch is equivalent to the native fetch web API, with a few additional features:

It can be used to make credentialed requests on the server, as it inherits the cookie and authorization headers for the page request.
It can make relative requests on the server (ordinarily, fetch requires a URL with an origin when used in a server context).
Internal requests (e.g. for +server.js routes) go directly to the handler function when running on the server, without the overhead of an HTTP call.
During server-side rendering, the response will be captured and inlined into the rendered HTML by hooking into the text and json methods of the Response object. Note that headers will not be serialized, unless explicitly included via filterSerializedResponseHeaders
During hydration, the response will be read from the HTML, guaranteeing consistency and preventing an additional network request.
You can learn more about making credentialed requests with cookies here.

getClientAddress: () => string;
The client’s IP address, set by the adapter.

locals: App.Locals;
Contains custom data that was added to the request within the server handle hook.

params: Params;
The parameters of the current route - e.g. for a route like /blog/[slug], a { slug: string } object.

platform: Readonly<App.Platform> | undefined;
Additional data made available through the adapter.

request: Request;
The original request object.

route: {…}
Info about the current route.

id: RouteId;
The ID of the current route - e.g. for src/routes/blog/[slug], it would be /blog/[slug]. It is null when no route is matched.

setHeaders: (headers: Record<string, string>) => void;
If you need to set headers for the response, you can do so using the this method. This is useful if you want the page to be cached, for example:

src/routes/blog/+page

export async function load({ fetch, setHeaders }) {

	const url = `https://cms.example.com/articles.json`;
	const response = await fetch(url);

	setHeaders({
		age: response.headers.get('age'),
		'cache-control': response.headers.get('cache-control')
	});

	return response.json();
}
Setting the same header multiple times (even in separate load functions) is an error — you can only set a given header once.

You cannot add a set-cookie header with setHeaders — use the cookies API instead.

url: URL;
The requested URL.

isDataRequest: boolean;
true if the request comes from the client asking for +page/layout.server.js data. The url property will be stripped of the internal information related to the data request in this case. Use this property instead if the distinction is important to you.

isSubRequest: boolean;
true for +server.js calls coming from SvelteKit without the overhead of actually making an HTTP request. This happens when you make same-origin fetch requests on the server.

tracing: {…}
available since v2.31.0
Access to spans for tracing. If tracing is not enabled, these spans will do nothing.

enabled: boolean;
Whether tracing is enabled.

root: Span;
The root span for the request. This span is named sveltekit.handle.root.

current: Span;
The span associated with the current handle hook, load function, or form action.

isRemoteRequest: boolean;
true if the request comes from the client via a remote function. The url property will be stripped of the internal information related to the data request in this case. Use this property instead if the distinction is important to you.

RequestHandler
A (event: RequestEvent) => Response function exported from a +server.js file that corresponds to an HTTP verb (GET, PUT, PATCH, etc) and handles requests with that method.

It receives Params as the first generic argument, which you can skip by using generated types instead.

type RequestHandler<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> = (
	event: RequestEvent<Params, RouteId>
) => MaybePromise<Response>;
Reroute
Available since 2.3.0

The reroute hook allows you to modify the URL before it is used to determine which route to render.

type Reroute = (event: {
	url: URL;
	fetch: typeof fetch;
}) => MaybePromise<void | string>;
ResolveOptions
interface ResolveOptions {…}
transformPageChunk?: (input: { html: string; done: boolean }) => MaybePromise<string | undefined>;
input the html chunk and the info if this is the last chunk
Applies custom transforms to HTML. If done is true, it’s the final chunk. Chunks are not guaranteed to be well-formed HTML (they could include an element’s opening tag but not its closing tag, for example) but they will always be split at sensible boundaries such as %sveltekit.head% or layout/page components.

filterSerializedResponseHeaders?: (name: string, value: string) => boolean;
name header name
value header value
Determines which headers should be included in serialized responses when a load function loads a resource with fetch. By default, none will be included.

preload?: (input: { type: 'font' | 'css' | 'js' | 'asset'; path: string }) => boolean;
input the type of the file and its path
Determines what should be added to the <head> tag to preload it. By default, js and css files will be preloaded.

RouteDefinition
interface RouteDefinition<Config = any> {…}
id: string;
api: {
	methods: Array<HttpMethod | '*'>;
};
page: {
	methods: Array<Extract<HttpMethod, 'GET' | 'POST'>>;
};
pattern: RegExp;
prerender: PrerenderOption;
segments: RouteSegment[];
methods: Array<HttpMethod | '*'>;
config: Config;
SSRManifest
interface SSRManifest {…}
appDir: string;
appPath: string;
assets: Set<string>;
Static files from kit.config.files.assets and the service worker (if any).

mimeTypes: Record<string, string>;
_: {…}
private fields

client: NonNullable<BuildData['client']>;
nodes: SSRNodeLoader[];
remotes: Record<string, () => Promise<any>>;
hashed filename -> import to that file

routes: SSRRoute[];
prerendered_routes: Set<string>;
matchers: () => Promise<Record<string, ParamMatcher>>;
server_assets: Record<string, number>;
A [file]: size map of all assets imported by server code.

ServerInit
Available since 2.10.0

The init will be invoked before the server responds to its first request

type ServerInit = () => MaybePromise<void>;
ServerInitOptions
interface ServerInitOptions {…}
env: Record<string, string>;
A map of environment variables.

read?: (file: string) => MaybePromise<ReadableStream | null>;
A function that turns an asset filename into a ReadableStream. Required for the read export from $app/server to work.

ServerLoad
The generic form of PageServerLoad and LayoutServerLoad. You should import those from ./$types (see generated types) rather than using ServerLoad directly.

type ServerLoad<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	ParentData extends Record<string, any> = Record<
		string,
		any
	>,
	OutputData extends Record<string, any> | void = Record<
		string,
		any
	> | void,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> = (
	event: ServerLoadEvent<Params, ParentData, RouteId>
) => MaybePromise<OutputData>;
ServerLoadEvent
interface ServerLoadEvent<
	Params extends
		AppLayoutParams<'/'> = AppLayoutParams<'/'>,
	ParentData extends Record<string, any> = Record<
		string,
		any
	>,
	RouteId extends AppRouteId | null = AppRouteId | null
> extends RequestEvent<Params, RouteId> {…}
parent: () => Promise<ParentData>;
await parent() returns data from parent +layout.server.js load functions.

Be careful not to introduce accidental waterfalls when using await parent(). If for example you only want to merge parent data into the returned output, call it after fetching your other data.

depends: (...deps: string[]) => void;
This function declares that the load function has a dependency on one or more URLs or custom identifiers, which can subsequently be used with invalidate() to cause load to rerun.

Most of the time you won’t need this, as fetch calls depends on your behalf — it’s only necessary if you’re using a custom API client that bypasses fetch.

URLs can be absolute or relative to the page being loaded, and must be encoded.

Custom identifiers have to be prefixed with one or more lowercase letters followed by a colon to conform to the URI specification.

The following example shows how to use depends to register a dependency on a custom identifier, which is invalidated after a button click, making the load function rerun.

src/routes/+page

let count = 0;
export async function load({ depends }) {
	depends('increase:count');

	return { count: count++ };
}
src/routes/+page

<script>
	import { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';

	let { data } = $props();

	const increase = async () => {
		await invalidate('increase:count');
	}
</script>

<p>{data.count}<p>
<button on:click={increase}>Increase Count</button>
untrack: <T>(fn: () => T) => T;
Use this function to opt out of dependency tracking for everything that is synchronously called within the callback. Example:

src/routes/+page

export async function load({ untrack, url }) {

	// Untrack url.pathname so that path changes don't trigger a rerun
	if (untrack(() => url.pathname === '/')) {
		return { message: 'Welcome!' };
	}
}
tracing: {…}
available since v2.31.0
Access to spans for tracing. If tracing is not enabled, these spans will do nothing.

enabled: boolean;
Whether tracing is enabled.

root: Span;
The root span for the request. This span is named sveltekit.handle.root.

current: Span;
The span associated with the current server load function.

Snapshot
The type of export const snapshot exported from a page or layout component.

interface Snapshot<T = any> {…}
capture: () => T;
restore: (snapshot: T) => void;
SubmitFunction
type SubmitFunction<
	Success extends
		| Record<string, unknown>
		| undefined = Record<string, any>,
	Failure extends
		| Record<string, unknown>
		| undefined = Record<string, any>
> = (input: {
	action: URL;
	formData: FormData;
	formElement: HTMLFormElement;
	controller: AbortController;
	submitter: HTMLElement | null;
	cancel: () => void;
}) => MaybePromise<
	| void
	| ((opts: {
			formData: FormData;
			formElement: HTMLFormElement;
			action: URL;
			result: ActionResult<Success, Failure>;
			/**
			 * Call this to get the default behavior of a form submission response.
			 * @param options Set `reset: false` if you don't want the `<form>` values to be reset after a successful submission.
			 * @param invalidateAll Set `invalidateAll: false` if you don't want the action to call `invalidateAll` after submission.
			 */
			update: (options?: {
				reset?: boolean;
				invalidateAll?: boolean;
			}) => Promise<void>;
	  }) => MaybePromise<void>)
>;
Transport
Available since 2.11.0

The transport hook allows you to transport custom types across the server/client boundary.

Each transporter has a pair of encode and decode functions. On the server, encode determines whether a value is an instance of the custom type and, if so, returns a non-falsy encoding of the value which can be an object or an array (or false otherwise).

In the browser, decode turns the encoding back into an instance of the custom type.


import type { Transport } from '@sveltejs/kit';

declare class MyCustomType {
	data: any
}

// hooks.js
export const transport: Transport = {
	MyCustomType: {
		encode: (value) => value instanceof MyCustomType && [value.data],
		decode: ([data]) => new MyCustomType(data)
	}
};
type Transport = Record<string, Transporter>;
Transporter
A member of the transport hook.

interface Transporter<
	T = any,
	U = Exclude<
		any,
		false | 0 | '' | null | undefined | typeof NaN
	>
> {…}
encode: (value: T) => false | U;
decode: (data: U) => T;
Private types
The following are referenced by the public types documented above, but cannot be imported directly:

AdapterEntry
interface AdapterEntry {…}
id: string;
A string that uniquely identifies an HTTP service (e.g. serverless function) and is used for deduplication. For example, /foo/a-[b] and /foo/[c] are different routes, but would both be represented in a Netlify _redirects file as /foo/:param, so they share an ID

filter(route: RouteDefinition): boolean;
A function that compares the candidate route with the current route to determine if it should be grouped with the current route.

Use cases:

Fallback pages: /foo/[c] is a fallback for /foo/a-[b], and /[...catchall] is a fallback for all routes
Grouping routes that share a common config: /foo should be deployed to the edge, /bar and /baz should be deployed to a serverless function
complete(entry: { generateManifest(opts: { relativePath: string }): string }): MaybePromise<void>;
A function that is invoked once the entry has been created. This is where you should write the function to the filesystem and generate redirect manifests.

sequence

import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';
sequence
A helper function for sequencing multiple handle calls in a middleware-like manner. The behavior for the handle options is as follows:

transformPageChunk is applied in reverse order and merged
preload is applied in forward order, the first option “wins” and no preload options after it are called
filterSerializedResponseHeaders behaves the same as preload
src/hooks.server

import { sequence } from '@sveltejs/kit/hooks';
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';

const first: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	console.log('first pre-processing');
	const result = await resolve(event, {
		transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => {
			// transforms are applied in reverse order
			console.log('first transform');
			return html;
		},
		preload: () => {
			// this one wins as it's the first defined in the chain
			console.log('first preload');
			return true;

applyAction
deserialize
enhance

import { applyAction, deserialize, enhance } from '$app/forms';
applyAction
This action updates the form property of the current page with the given data and updates page.status. In case of an error, it redirects to the nearest error page.

function applyAction<
	Success extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,
	Failure extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined
>(
	result: import('@sveltejs/kit').ActionResult<
		Success,
		Failure
	>
): Promise<void>;
deserialize
Use this function to deserialize the response from a form submission. Usage:


import { deserialize } from '$app/forms';

async function handleSubmit(event) {
	const response = await fetch('/form?/action', {
		method: 'POST',
		body: new FormData(event.target)
	});

	const result = deserialize(await response.text());
	// ...
}
function deserialize<
	Success extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,
	Failure extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined
>(
	result: string
): import('@sveltejs/kit').ActionResult<Success, Failure>;
enhance
This action enhances a <form> element that otherwise would work without JavaScript.

The submit function is called upon submission with the given FormData and the action that should be triggered. If cancel is called, the form will not be submitted. You can use the abort controller to cancel the submission in case another one starts. If a function is returned, that function is called with the response from the server. If nothing is returned, the fallback will be used.

If this function or its return value isn’t set, it

falls back to updating the form prop with the returned data if the action is on the same page as the form
updates page.status
resets the <form> element and invalidates all data in case of successful submission with no redirect response
redirects in case of a redirect response
redirects to the nearest error page in case of an unexpected error
If you provide a custom function with a callback and want to use the default behavior, invoke update in your callback. It accepts an options object

reset: false if you don’t want the <form> values to be reset after a successful submission
invalidateAll: false if you don’t want the action to call invalidateAll after submission
function enhance<
	Success extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined,

	preloadData,

} from '$app/navigation';
afterNavigate
A lifecycle function that runs the supplied callback when the current component mounts, and also whenever we navigate to a URL.

afterNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.

function afterNavigate(
	callback: (
		navigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').AfterNavigate
	) => void
): void;
beforeNavigate
A navigation interceptor that triggers before we navigate to a URL, whether by clicking a link, calling goto(...), or using the browser back/forward controls.

Calling cancel() will prevent the navigation from completing. If navigation.type === 'leave' — meaning the user is navigating away from the app (or closing the tab) — calling cancel will trigger the native browser unload confirmation dialog. In this case, the navigation may or may not be cancelled depending on the user’s response.

When a navigation isn’t to a SvelteKit-owned route (and therefore controlled by SvelteKit’s client-side router), navigation.to.route.id will be null.

If the navigation will (if not cancelled) cause the document to unload — in other words 'leave' navigations and 'link' navigations where navigation.to.route === null — navigation.willUnload is true.

beforeNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.

function beforeNavigate(
	callback: (
		navigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').BeforeNavigate
	) => void
): void;
disableScrollHandling
If called when the page is being updated following a navigation (in onMount or afterNavigate or an action, for example), this disables SvelteKit’s built-in scroll handling. This is generally discouraged, since it breaks user expectations.

function disableScrollHandling(): void;
goto
Allows you to navigate programmatically to a given route, with options such as keeping the current element focused. Returns a Promise that resolves when SvelteKit navigates (or fails to navigate, in which case the promise rejects) to the specified url.

For external URLs, use window.location = url instead of calling goto(url).

function goto(
	url: string | URL,
	opts?: {
		replaceState?: boolean | undefined;
		noScroll?: boolean | undefined;
		keepFocus?: boolean | undefined;
		invalidateAll?: boolean | undefined;
		invalidate?:
			| (string | URL | ((url: URL) => boolean))[]
			| undefined;
		state?: App.PageState | undefined;
	}
): Promise<void>;
invalidate
Causes any load functions belonging to the currently active page to re-run if they depend on the url in question, via fetch or depends. Returns a Promise that resolves when the page is subsequently updated.

If the argument is given as a string or URL, it must resolve to the same URL that was passed to fetch or depends (including query parameters). To create a custom identifier, use a string beginning with [a-z]+: (e.g. custom:state) — this is a valid URL.

The function argument can be used define a custom predicate. It receives the full URL and causes load to rerun if true is returned. This can be useful if you want to invalidate based on a pattern instead of a exact match.


// Example: Match '/path' regardless of the query parameters
import { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';

invalidate((url) => url.pathname === '/path');
function invalidate(
	resource: string | URL | ((url: URL) => boolean)
): Promise<void>;
invalidateAll
Causes all load functions belonging to the currently active page to re-run. Returns a Promise that resolves when the page is subsequently updated.

function invalidateAll(): Promise<void>;
onNavigate
A lifecycle function that runs the supplied callback immediately before we navigate to a new URL except during full-page navigations.

If you return a Promise, SvelteKit will wait for it to resolve before completing the navigation. This allows you to — for example — use document.startViewTransition. Avoid promises that are slow to resolve, since navigation will appear stalled to the user.

If a function (or a Promise that resolves to a function) is returned from the callback, it will be called once the DOM has updated.

onNavigate must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.

function onNavigate(
	callback: (
		navigation: import('@sveltejs/kit').OnNavigate
	) => MaybePromise<(() => void) | void>
): void;
preloadCode
Programmatically imports the code for routes that haven’t yet been fetched. Typically, you might call this to speed up subsequent navigation.

You can specify routes by any matching pathname such as /about (to match src/routes/about/+page.svelte) or /blog/* (to match src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte).

Unlike preloadData, this won’t call load functions. Returns a Promise that resolves when the modules have been imported.

function preloadCode(pathname: string): Promise<void>;
preloadData
Programmatically preloads the given page, which means

ensuring that the code for the page is loaded, and
calling the page’s load function with the appropriate options.
This is the same behaviour that SvelteKit triggers when the user taps or mouses over an <a> element with data-sveltekit-preload-data. If the next navigation is to href, the values returned from load will be used, making navigation instantaneous. Returns a Promise that resolves with the result of running the new route’s load functions once the preload is complete.

function preloadData(href: string): Promise<
	| {
			type: 'loaded';
			status: number;
			data: Record<string, any>;
	  }
	| {
			type: 'redirect';
			location: string;
	  }
>;
pushState
Programmatically create a new history entry with the given page.state. To use the current URL, you can pass '' as the first argument. Used for shallow routing.

function pushState(
	url: string | URL,
	state: App.PageState
): void;
refreshAll
Causes all currently active remote functions to refresh, and all load functions belonging to the currently active page to re-run (unless disabled via the option argument). Returns a Promise that resolves when the page is subsequently updated.

function refreshAll({
	includeLoadFunctions
}?: {
	includeLoadFunctions?: boolean;
}): Promise<void>;
replaceState
Programmatically replace the current history entry with the given page.state. To use the current URL, you can pass '' as the first argument. Used for shallow routing.

function replaceState(
	url: string | URL,
	state: App.PageState
): void;

updated
SvelteKit makes three read-only state objects available via the $app/state module — page, navigating and updated.

This module was added in 2.12. If you’re using an earlier version of SvelteKit, use $app/stores instead.


import { navigating, page, updated } from '$app/state';
navigating
A read-only object representing an in-progress navigation, with from, to, type and (if type === 'popstate') delta properties. Values are null when no navigation is occurring, or during server rendering.

const navigating:
	| import('@sveltejs/kit').Navigation
	| {
			from: null;
			to: null;
			type: null;
			willUnload: null;
			delta: null;
			complete: null;
	  };
page
A read-only reactive object with information about the current page, serving several use cases:

retrieving the combined data of all pages/layouts anywhere in your component tree (also see loading data)
retrieving the current value of the form prop anywhere in your component tree (also see form actions)
retrieving the page state that was set through goto, pushState or replaceState (also see goto and shallow routing)
retrieving metadata such as the URL you’re on, the current route and its parameters, and whether or not there was an error
+layout

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
</script>

<p>Currently at {page.url.pathname}</p>

{#if page.error}
	<span class="red">Problem detected</span>
{:else}
	<span class="small">All systems operational</span>
{/if}
Changes to page are available exclusively with runes. (The legacy reactivity syntax will not reflect any changes)

+page

<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	const id = $derived(page.params.id); // This will correctly update id for usage on this page
	$: badId = page.params.id; // Do not use; will never update after initial load
</script>
On the server, values can only be read during rendering (in other words not in e.g. load functions). In the browser, the values can be read at any time.

const page: import('@sveltejs/kit').Page;
updated
A read-only reactive value that’s initially false. If version.pollInterval is a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions of the app and update current to true when it detects one. updated.check() will force an immediate check, regardless of polling.

const updated: {
	get current(): boolean;
	check(): Promise<boolean>;
};

function getStores(): {
	page: typeof page;

	navigating: typeof navigating;

	updated: typeof updated;
};
navigating
Use navigating from $app/state instead (requires Svelte 5, see docs for more info)

A readable store. When navigating starts, its value is a Navigation object with from, to, type and (if type === 'popstate') delta properties. When navigating finishes, its value reverts to null.

On the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.

const navigating: import('svelte/store').Readable<
	import('@sveltejs/kit').Navigation | null
>;
page
Use page from $app/state instead (requires Svelte 5, see docs for more info)

A readable store whose value contains page data.

On the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.

const page: import('svelte/store').Readable<
	import('@sveltejs/kit').Page
>;
updated
Use updated from $app/state instead (requires Svelte 5, see docs for more info)

A readable store whose initial value is false. If version.pollInterval is a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions of the app and update the store value to true when it detects one. updated.check() will force an immediate check, regardless of polling.

On the server, this store can only be subscribed to during component initialization. In the browser, it can be subscribed to at any time.

RouteParams
LayoutParams
This module contains generated types for the routes in your app.

Available since 2.26


import type { RouteId, RouteParams, LayoutParams } from '$app/types';
Asset
A union of all the filenames of assets contained in your static directory, plus a string wildcard for asset paths generated from import declarations.

type Asset = '/favicon.png' | '/robots.txt' | (string & {});
RouteId
A union of all the route IDs in your app. Used for page.route.id and event.route.id.

type RouteId = '/' | '/my-route' | '/my-other-route/[param]';
Pathname
A union of all valid pathnames in your app.

type Pathname = '/' | '/my-route' | `/my-other-route/${string}` & {};
ResolvedPathname
Similar to Pathname, but possibly prefixed with a base path. Used for page.url.pathname.

type ResolvedPathname = `${'' | `/${string}`}/` | `${'' | `/${string}`}/my-route` | `${'' | `/${string}`}/my-other-route/${string}` | {};
RouteParams
A utility for getting the parameters associated with a given route.


type BlogParams = RouteParams<'/blog/[slug]'>; // { slug: string }
type RouteParams<T extends RouteId> = { /* generated */ } | Record<string, never>;
LayoutParams
A utility for getting the parameters associated with a given layout, which is similar to RouteParams but also includes optional parameters for any child route.

type RouteParams<T extends RouteId> = { /* generated */ } | Record<string, never>;

$env/dynamic/private
On this page
$env/dynamic/private
This module provides access to runtime environment variables, as defined by the platform you’re running on. For example if you’re using adapter-node (or running vite preview), this is equivalent to process.env. This module only includes variables that do not begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix and do start with config.kit.env.privatePrefix (if configured).

This module cannot be imported into client-side code.


import { env } from '$env/dynamic/private';
console.log(env.DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);
In dev, $env/dynamic always includes environment variables from .env. In prod, this behavior will depend on your adapter.
SvelteKitReference
$env/dynamic/public
On this page
$env/dynamic/public
Similar to $env/dynamic/private, but only includes variables that begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix (which defaults to PUBLIC_), and can therefore safely be exposed to client-side code.

Note that public dynamic environment variables must all be sent from the server to the client, causing larger network requests — when possible, use $env/static/public instead.


import { env } from '$env/dynamic/public';
console.log(env.PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);
SvelteKitReference
$env/static/private
On this page
$env/static/private
Environment variables loaded by Vite from .env files and process.env. Like $env/dynamic/private, this module cannot be imported into client-side code. This module only includes variables that do not begin with config.kit.env.publicPrefix and do start with config.kit.env.privatePrefix (if configured).

Unlike $env/dynamic/private, the values exported from this module are statically injected into your bundle at build time, enabling optimisations like dead code elimination.


import { API_KEY } from '$env/static/private';
Note that all environment variables referenced in your code should be declared (for example in an .env file), even if they don’t have a value until the app is deployed:

MY_FEATURE_FLAG=""
You can override .env values from the command line like so:


MY_FEATURE_FLAG="enabled" npm run dev

import { base, build, files, prerendered, version } from '$service-worker';
This module is only available to service workers.

base
The base path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to config.kit.paths.base, but it is calculated from location.pathname meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory. Note that there is a base but no assets, since service workers cannot be used if config.kit.paths.assets is specified.

const base: string;
build
An array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with cache.addAll(build). During development, this is an empty array.

const build: string[];
files
An array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by config.kit.files.assets. You can customize which files are included from static directory using config.kit.serviceWorker.files

An array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints. During development, this is an empty array.

const prerendered: string[];
version
See config.kit.version. It’s useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.

Your project’s configuration lives in a svelte.config.js file at the root of your project. As well as SvelteKit, this config object is used by other tooling that integrates with Svelte such as editor extensions.

svelte.config

import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-auto';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		adapter: adapter()
	}
};

export default config;
Config
An extension of vite-plugin-svelte’s options.

interface Config extends SvelteConfig {…}
kit?: KitConfig;
SvelteKit options.

[key: string]: any;
Any additional options required by tooling that integrates with Svelte.

KitConfig
The kit property configures SvelteKit, and can have the following properties:

adapter
default undefined
Your adapter is run when executing vite build. It determines how the output is converted for different platforms.

alias
default {}
An object containing zero or more aliases used to replace values in import statements. These aliases are automatically passed to Vite and TypeScript.

svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		alias: {
			// this will match a file
			'my-file': 'path/to/my-file.js',

			// this will match a directory and its contents
			// (`my-directory/x` resolves to `path/to/my-directory/x`)
			'my-directory': 'path/to/my-directory',

			// an alias ending /* will only match
			// the contents of a directory, not the directory itself
			'my-directory/*': 'path/to/my-directory/*'
		}
	}
};
The built-in $lib alias is controlled by config.kit.files.lib as it is used for packaging.

You will need to run npm run dev to have SvelteKit automatically generate the required alias configuration in jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json.

appDir
default "_app"
The directory where SvelteKit keeps its stuff, including static assets (such as JS and CSS) and internally-used routes.

If paths.assets is specified, there will be two app directories — ${paths.assets}/${appDir} and ${paths.base}/${appDir}.

csp
Content Security Policy configuration. CSP helps to protect your users against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by limiting the places resources can be loaded from. For example, a configuration like this...

svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		csp: {
			directives: {
				'script-src': ['self']
			},
			// must be specified with either the `report-uri` or `report-to` directives, or both
			reportOnly: {
				'script-src': ['self'],
				'report-uri': ['/']
			}
		}
	}
};

export default config;
...would prevent scripts loading from external sites. SvelteKit will augment the specified directives with nonces or hashes (depending on mode) for any inline styles and scripts it generates.

To add a nonce for scripts and links manually included in src/app.html, you may use the placeholder %sveltekit.nonce% (for example <script nonce="%sveltekit.nonce%">).

When pages are prerendered, the CSP header is added via a <meta http-equiv> tag (note that in this case, frame-ancestors, report-uri and sandbox directives will be ignored).

When mode is 'auto', SvelteKit will use nonces for dynamically rendered pages and hashes for prerendered pages. Using nonces with prerendered pages is insecure and therefore forbidden.

Note that most Svelte transitions work by creating an inline <style> element. If you use these in your app, you must either leave the style-src directive unspecified or add unsafe-inline.

If this level of configuration is insufficient and you have more dynamic requirements, you can use the handle hook to roll your own CSP.


mode?: 'hash' | 'nonce' | 'auto';
Whether to use hashes or nonces to restrict <script> and <style> elements. 'auto' will use hashes for prerendered pages, and nonces for dynamically rendered pages.


directives?: CspDirectives;
Directives that will be added to Content-Security-Policy headers.


reportOnly?: CspDirectives;
Directives that will be added to Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only headers.

csrf
Protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.


checkOrigin?: boolean;
default true
deprecated Use trustedOrigins: ['*'] instead
Whether to check the incoming origin header for POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE form submissions and verify that it matches the server’s origin.

To allow people to make POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests with a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain to your app from other origins, you will need to disable this option. Be careful!


trustedOrigins?: string[];
default []
An array of origins that are allowed to make cross-origin form submissions to your app.

Each origin should be a complete origin including protocol (e.g., https://payment-gateway.com). This is useful for allowing trusted third-party services like payment gateways or authentication providers to submit forms to your app.

If the array contains '*', all origins will be trusted. This is generally not recommended!

Only add origins you completely trust, as this bypasses CSRF protection for those origins.

CSRF checks only apply in production, not in local development.

embedded
default false
Whether or not the app is embedded inside a larger app. If true, SvelteKit will add its event listeners related to navigation etc on the parent of %sveltekit.body% instead of window, and will pass params from the server rather than inferring them from location.pathname. Note that it is generally not supported to embed multiple SvelteKit apps on the same page and use client-side SvelteKit features within them (things such as pushing to the history state assume a single instance).

env
Environment variable configuration


dir?: string;
default "."
The directory to search for .env files.


publicPrefix?: string;
default "PUBLIC_"
A prefix that signals that an environment variable is safe to expose to client-side code. See $env/static/public and $env/dynamic/public. Note that Vite’s envPrefix must be set separately if you are using Vite’s environment variable handling - though use of that feature should generally be unnecessary.


privatePrefix?: string;
default ""
available since v1.21.0
A prefix that signals that an environment variable is unsafe to expose to client-side code. Environment variables matching neither the public nor the private prefix will be discarded completely. See $env/static/private and $env/dynamic/private.

experimental
Experimental features. Here be dragons. These are not subject to semantic versioning, so breaking changes or removal can happen in any release.


tracing?: {…}
default { server: false, serverFile: false }
available since v2.31.0
Options for enabling server-side OpenTelemetry tracing for SvelteKit operations including the handle hook, load functions, form actions, and remote functions.


server?: boolean;
default false
available since v2.31.0
Enables server-side OpenTelemetry span emission for SvelteKit operations including the handle hook, load functions, form actions, and remote functions.


instrumentation?: {…}
available since v2.31.0

server?: boolean;
default false
available since v2.31.0
Enables instrumentation.server.js for tracing and observability instrumentation.


remoteFunctions?: boolean;
default false
Whether to enable the experimental remote functions feature. This feature is not yet stable and may be changed or removed at any time.

files
deprecated
Where to find various files within your project.


src?: string;
deprecated
default "src"
available since v2.28
the location of your source code


assets?: string;
deprecated
default "static"
a place to put static files that should have stable URLs and undergo no processing, such as favicon.ico or manifest.json


hooks?: {…}

client?: string;
deprecated
default "src/hooks.client"
The location of your client hooks.


server?: string;
deprecated
default "src/hooks.server"
The location of your server hooks.


universal?: string;
deprecated
default "src/hooks"
available since v2.3.0
The location of your universal hooks.


lib?: string;
deprecated
default "src/lib"
your app’s internal library, accessible throughout the codebase as $lib


params?: string;
deprecated
default "src/params"
a directory containing parameter matchers


routes?: string;
deprecated
default "src/routes"
the files that define the structure of your app (see Routing)


serviceWorker?: string;
deprecated
default "src/service-worker"
the location of your service worker’s entry point (see Service workers)


appTemplate?: string;
deprecated
default "src/app.html"
the location of the template for HTML responses


errorTemplate?: string;
deprecated
default "src/error.html"
the location of the template for fallback error responses

inlineStyleThreshold
default 0
Inline CSS inside a <style> block at the head of the HTML. This option is a number that specifies the maximum length of a CSS file in UTF-16 code units, as specified by the String.length property, to be inlined. All CSS files needed for the page that are smaller than this value are merged and inlined in a <style> block.

This results in fewer initial requests and can improve your First Contentful Paint score. However, it generates larger HTML output and reduces the effectiveness of browser caches. Use it advisedly.

moduleExtensions
default [".js", ".ts"]
An array of file extensions that SvelteKit will treat as modules. Files with extensions that match neither config.extensions nor config.kit.moduleExtensions will be ignored by the router.

outDir
default ".svelte-kit"
The directory that SvelteKit writes files to during dev and build. You should exclude this directory from version control.

output
Options related to the build output format


preloadStrategy?: 'modulepreload' | 'preload-js' | 'preload-mjs';
default "modulepreload"
available since v1.8.4
SvelteKit will preload the JavaScript modules needed for the initial page to avoid import ‘waterfalls’, resulting in faster application startup. There are three strategies with different trade-offs:

modulepreload - uses <link rel="modulepreload">. This delivers the best results in Chromium-based browsers, in Firefox 115+, and Safari 17+. It is ignored in older browsers.
preload-js - uses <link rel="preload">. Prevents waterfalls in Chromium and Safari, but Chromium will parse each module twice (once as a script, once as a module). Causes modules to be requested twice in Firefox. This is a good setting if you want to maximise performance for users on iOS devices at the cost of a very slight degradation for Chromium users.
preload-mjs - uses <link rel="preload"> but with the .mjs extension which prevents double-parsing in Chromium. Some static webservers will fail to serve .mjs files with a Content-Type: application/javascript header, which will cause your application to break. If that doesn’t apply to you, this is the option that will deliver the best performance for the largest number of users, until modulepreload is more widely supported.

bundleStrategy?: 'split' | 'single' | 'inline';
default 'split'
available since v2.13.0
The bundle strategy option affects how your app’s JavaScript and CSS files are loaded.

If 'split', splits the app up into multiple .js/.css files so that they are loaded lazily as the user navigates around the app. This is the default, and is recommended for most scenarios.
If 'single', creates just one .js bundle and one .css file containing code for the entire app.
If 'inline', inlines all JavaScript and CSS of the entire app into the HTML. The result is usable without a server (i.e. you can just open the file in your browser).
When using 'split', you can also adjust the bundling behaviour by setting output.experimentalMinChunkSize and output.manualChunks inside your Vite config’s build.rollupOptions.

If you want to inline your assets, you’ll need to set Vite’s build.assetsInlineLimit option to an appropriate size then import your assets through Vite.

vite.config

import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [sveltekit()],
	build: {
		// inline all imported assets
		assetsInlineLimit: Infinity
	}
});
src/routes/+layout

<script lang="ts">
	// import the asset through Vite
	import favicon from './favicon.png';
</script>

<svelte:head>
	<!-- this asset will be inlined as a base64 URL -->
	<link rel="icon" href={favicon} />
</svelte:head>
paths

assets?: '' | `http://${string}` | `https://${string}`;
default ""
An absolute path that your app’s files are served from. This is useful if your files are served from a storage bucket of some kind.


base?: '' | `/${string}`;
default ""
A root-relative path that must start, but not end with / (e.g. /base-path), unless it is the empty string. This specifies where your app is served from and allows the app to live on a non-root path. Note that you need to prepend all your root-relative links with the base value or they will point to the root of your domain, not your base (this is how the browser works). You can use base from $app/paths for that: <a href="{base}/your-page">Link</a>. If you find yourself writing this often, it may make sense to extract this into a reusable component.


relative?: boolean;
default true
available since v1.9.0
Whether to use relative asset paths.

If true, base and assets imported from $app/paths will be replaced with relative asset paths during server-side rendering, resulting in more portable HTML. If false, %sveltekit.assets% and references to build artifacts will always be root-relative paths, unless paths.assets is an external URL

Single-page app fallback pages will always use absolute paths, regardless of this setting.

If your app uses a <base> element, you should set this to false, otherwise asset URLs will incorrectly be resolved against the <base> URL rather than the current page.

In 1.0, undefined was a valid value, which was set by default. In that case, if paths.assets was not external, SvelteKit would replace %sveltekit.assets% with a relative path and use relative paths to reference build artifacts, but base and assets imported from $app/paths would be as specified in your config.

prerender
See Prerendering.


concurrency?: number;
default 1
How many pages can be prerendered simultaneously. JS is single-threaded, but in cases where prerendering performance is network-bound (for example loading content from a remote CMS) this can speed things up by processing other tasks while waiting on the network response.


crawl?: boolean;
default true
Whether SvelteKit should find pages to prerender by following links from entries.


entries?: Array<'*' | `/${string}`>;
default ["*"]
An array of pages to prerender, or start crawling from (if crawl: true). The * string includes all routes containing no required [parameters] with optional parameters included as being empty (since SvelteKit doesn’t know what value any parameters should have).


handleHttpError?: PrerenderHttpErrorHandlerValue;
default "fail"
available since v1.15.7
How to respond to HTTP errors encountered while prerendering the app.

'fail' — fail the build
'ignore' - silently ignore the failure and continue
'warn' — continue, but print a warning
(details) => void — a custom error handler that takes a details object with status, path, referrer, referenceType and message properties. If you throw from this function, the build will fail
svelte.config

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
	kit: {
		prerender: {
			handleHttpError: ({ path, referrer, message }) => {
				// ignore deliberate link to shiny 404 page
				if (path === '/not-found' && referrer === '/blog/how-we-built-our-404-page') {
					return;
				}

				// otherwise fail the build
				throw new Error(message);
			}
		}
	}
};

handleMissingId?: PrerenderMissingIdHandlerValue;
default "fail"
available since v1.15.7
How to respond when hash links from one prerendered page to another don’t correspond to an id on the destination page.

'fail' — fail the build
'ignore' - silently ignore the failure and continue
'warn' — continue, but print a warning
(details) => void — a custom error handler that takes a details object with path, id, referrers and message properties. If you throw from this function, the build will fail

handleEntryGeneratorMismatch?: PrerenderEntryGeneratorMismatchHandlerValue;
default "fail"
available since v1.16.0
How to respond when an entry generated by the entries export doesn’t match the route it was generated from.

'fail' — fail the build
'ignore' - silently ignore the failure and continue
'warn' — continue, but print a warning
(details) => void — a custom error handler that takes a details object with generatedFromId, entry, matchedId and message properties. If you throw from this function, the build will fail

handleUnseenRoutes?: PrerenderUnseenRoutesHandlerValue;
default "fail"
available since v2.16.0
How to respond when a route is marked as prerenderable but has not been prerendered.

'fail' — fail the build
'ignore' - silently ignore the failure and continue
'warn' — continue, but print a warning
(details) => void — a custom error handler that takes a details object with a routes property which contains all routes that haven’t been prerendered. If you throw from this function, the build will fail
The default behavior is to fail the build. This may be undesirable when you know that some of your routes may never be reached under certain circumstances such as a CMS not returning data for a specific area, resulting in certain routes never being reached.


origin?: string;
default "http://sveltekit-prerender"
The value of url.origin during prerendering; useful if it is included in rendered content.

router

type?: 'pathname' | 'hash';
default "pathname"
available since v2.14.0
What type of client-side router to use.

'pathname' is the default and means the current URL pathname determines the route
'hash' means the route is determined by location.hash. In this case, SSR and prerendering are disabled. This is only recommended if pathname is not an option, for example because you don’t control the webserver where your app is deployed. It comes with some caveats: you can’t use server-side rendering (or indeed any server logic), and you have to make sure that the links in your app all start with #/, or they won’t work. Beyond that, everything works exactly like a normal SvelteKit app.

resolution?: 'client' | 'server';
default "client"
available since v2.17.0
How to determine which route to load when navigating to a new page.

By default, SvelteKit will serve a route manifest to the browser. When navigating, this manifest is used (along with the reroute hook, if it exists) to determine which components to load and which load functions to run. Because everything happens on the client, this decision can be made immediately. The drawback is that the manifest needs to be loaded and parsed before the first navigation can happen, which may have an impact if your app contains many routes.

Alternatively, SvelteKit can determine the route on the server. This means that for every navigation to a path that has not yet been visited, the server will be asked to determine the route. This has several advantages:

The client does not need to load the routing manifest upfront, which can lead to faster initial page loads
The list of routes is hidden from public view
The server has an opportunity to intercept each navigation (for example through a middleware), enabling (for example) A/B testing opaque to SvelteKit
The drawback is that for unvisited paths, resolution will take slightly longer (though this is mitigated by preloading).

When using server-side route resolution and prerendering, the resolution is prerendered along with the route itself.

serviceWorker
typescript

config?: (config: Record<string, any>) => Record<string, any> | void;
default (config) => config
available since v1.3.0
A function that allows you to edit the generated tsconfig.json. You can mutate the config (recommended) or return a new one. This is useful for extending a shared tsconfig.json in a monorepo root, for example.

Note that any paths configured here should be relative to the generated config file, which is written to .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json.

version
Client-side navigation can be buggy if you deploy a new version of your app while people are using it. If the code for the new page is already loaded, it may have stale content; if it isn’t, the app’s route manifest may point to a JavaScript file that no longer exists. SvelteKit helps you solve this problem through version management. If SvelteKit encounters an error while loading the page and detects that a new version has been deployed (using the name specified here, which defaults to a timestamp of the build) it will fall back to traditional full-page navigation. Not all navigations will result in an error though, for example if the JavaScript for the next page is already loaded. If you still want to force a full-page navigation in these cases, use techniques such as setting the pollInterval and then using beforeNavigate:

+layout

<script>
	import { beforeNavigate } from '$app/navigation';
	import { updated } from '$app/state';

	beforeNavigate(({ willUnload, to }) => {
		if (updated.current && !willUnload && to?.url) {
			location.href = to.url.href;
		}
	});
</script>
If you set pollInterval to a non-zero value, SvelteKit will poll for new versions in the background and set the value of updated.current true when it detects one.


name?: string;
The current app version string. If specified, this must be deterministic (e.g. a commit ref rather than Math.random() or Date.now().toString()), otherwise defaults to a timestamp of the build.

For example, to use the current commit hash, you could do use git rev-parse HEAD:

svelte.config

import * as child_process from 'node:child_process';

export default {
	kit: {
		version: {
			name: child_process.execSync('git rev-parse HEAD').toString().trim()
		}
	}
};

pollInterval?: number;
default 0
The interval in milliseconds to poll for version changes. If this is 0, no polling occurs.

SvelteKitReference
Command Line Interface

Command Line Interface
svelte-kit sync
SvelteKit projects use Vite, meaning you’ll mostly use its CLI (albeit via npm run dev/build/preview scripts):

vite dev — start a development server
vite build — build a production version of your app
vite preview — run the production version locally
However SvelteKit includes its own CLI for initialising your project:

svelte-kit sync
svelte-kit sync creates the tsconfig.json and all generated types (which you can import as ./$types inside routing files) for your project. When you create a new project, it is listed as the prepare script and will be run automatically as part of the npm lifecycle, so you should not ordinarily have to run this command.

Generated types
The RequestHandler and Load types both accept a Params argument allowing you to type the params object. For example this endpoint expects foo, bar and baz params:

src/routes/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]/+server

import type { RequestHandler } from '@sveltejs/kit';
export const GET: RequestHandler<{
	foo: string;
	bar: string;
	baz: string
  }> = async ({ params }) => {
	// ...
};
Needless to say, this is cumbersome to write out, and less portable (if you were to rename the [foo] directory to [qux], the type would no longer reflect reality).

To solve this problem, SvelteKit generates .d.ts files for each of your endpoints and pages:

.svelte-kit/types/src/routes/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]/$types.d

import type * as Kit from '@sveltejs/kit';

type RouteParams = {
	foo: string;
	bar: string;
	baz: string;
};

export type RequestHandler = Kit.RequestHandler<RouteParams>;
export type PageLoad = Kit.Load<RouteParams>;
These files can be imported into your endpoints and pages as siblings, thanks to the rootDirs option in your TypeScript configuration:

src/routes/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]/+server

import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const GET: RequestHandler = async ({ params }) => {
	// ...
};
src/routes/[foo]/[bar]/[baz]/+page

import type { PageLoad } from './$types';

export const load: PageLoad = async ({ params, fetch }) => {
	// ...
};
The return types of the load functions are then available through the $types module as PageData and LayoutData respectively, while the union of the return values of all Actions is available as ActionData.

Starting with version 2.16.0, two additional helper types are provided: PageProps defines data: PageData, as well as form: ActionData, when there are actions defined, while LayoutProps defines data: LayoutData, as well as children: Snippet.

src/routes/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageProps } from './$types';

	let { data, form }: PageProps = $props();
</script>
Before 2.16.0:

src/routes/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageData, ActionData } from './$types';

	let { data, form }: { data: PageData, form: ActionData } = $props();
</script>
Using Svelte 4:

src/routes/+page

<script lang="ts">
	import type { PageData, ActionData } from './$types';

  
  export let data: PageData;
  
  export let form: ActionData;
</script>
For this to work, your own tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json should extend from the generated .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json (where .svelte-kit is your outDir):

{ "extends": "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json" }

Default tsconfig.json
The generated .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json file contains a mixture of options. Some are generated programmatically based on your project configuration, and should generally not be overridden without good reason:

.svelte-kit/tsconfig

{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"paths": {
			"$lib": ["../src/lib"],
			"$lib/*": ["../src/lib/*"]
		},
		"rootDirs": ["..", "./types"]
	},
	"include": [
		"ambient.d.ts",
		"non-ambient.d.ts",
		"./types/**/$types.d.ts",
		"../vite.config.js",
		"../vite.config.ts",
		"../src/**/*.js",
		"../src/**/*.ts",
		"../src/**/*.svelte",
		"../tests/**/*.js",
		"../tests/**/*.ts",
		"../tests/**/*.svelte"
	],
	"exclude": [
		"../node_modules/**",
		"../src/service-worker.js",
		"../src/service-worker/**/*.js",
		"../src/service-worker.ts",
		"../src/service-worker/**/*.ts",
		"../src/service-worker.d.ts",
		"../src/service-worker/**/*.d.ts"
	]
}
Others are required for SvelteKit to work properly, and should also be left untouched unless you know what you’re doing:

.svelte-kit/tsconfig

{
	"compilerOptions": {
		// this ensures that types are explicitly
		// imported with `import type`, which is
		// necessary as Svelte/Vite cannot
		// otherwise compile components correctly
		"verbatimModuleSyntax": true,

		// Vite compiles one TypeScript module
		// at a time, rather than compiling
		// the entire module graph
		"isolatedModules": true,

		// Tell TS it's used only for type-checking
		"noEmit": true,

		// This ensures both `vite build`
		// and `svelte-package` work correctly
		"lib": ["esnext", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
		"moduleResolution": "bundler",
		"module": "esnext",
		"target": "esnext"
	}
}
Use the typescript.config setting in svelte.config.js to extend or modify the generated tsconfig.json.

$lib
This is a simple alias to src/lib, or whatever directory is specified as config.kit.files.lib. It allows you to access common components and utility modules without ../../../../ nonsense.

$lib/server
A subdirectory of $lib. SvelteKit will prevent you from importing any modules in $lib/server into client-side code. See server-only modules.

app.d.ts
The app.d.ts file is home to the ambient types of your apps, i.e. types that are available without explicitly importing them.

Always part of this file is the App namespace. This namespace contains several types that influence the shape of certain SvelteKit features you interact with.

Error
Defines the common shape of expected and unexpected errors. Expected errors are thrown using the error function. Unexpected errors are handled by the handleError hooks which should return this shape.

interface Error {…}
message: string;
Locals
The interface that defines event.locals, which can be accessed in server hooks (handle, and handleError), server-only load functions, and +server.js files.

interface Locals {}
PageData
Defines the common shape of the page.data state and $page.data store - that is, the data that is shared between all pages. The Load and ServerLoad functions in ./$types will be narrowed accordingly. Use optional properties for data that is only present on specific pages. Do not add an index signature ([key: string]: any).

interface PageData {}
PageState
The shape of the page.state object, which can be manipulated using the pushState and replaceState functions from $app/navigation.

interface PageState {}
Platform
If your adapter provides platform-specific context via event.platform, you can specify it here.

interface Platform {}
